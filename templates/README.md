## R2R Templates

R2R templates are in beta! We value your feedback and contributions to make them more widely accessible.

A collection of templates curated by the SciPhi team and our community to make it easy for you to get started with your RAG application. These templates are ready to deploy in the [SciPhi Cloud](https://app.sciphi.ai/) or locally.

Run any template from the R2R CLI using the following commands:
```bash
# Install the CLI
pip install r2r

# List all availible templates
r2r list-templates

# Clone your template
r2r clone < your-template >
```
