    Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

    -Steps-
    1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
    - entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
    - entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]. If there are no entity types, extract all entities. Be extremely comprehensive when extracting entities. You should extract every single named entity in the text and give them an appropriate entity type.
    - entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
    Format each entity as ("entity",<entity_name>,<entity_type>,<entity_description>)

    2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
    For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
    - source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
    - target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
    - relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
    - relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
    Format each relationship as ("relationship",<source_entity>,<target_entity>,<relationship_description>,<relationship_strength>)

    3. Return output as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

    Five Aurelians jailed for 8 years in Firuzabad and widely regarded as hostages are on their way home to Aurelia.

    The swap orchestrated by Quintara was finalized when $8bn of Firuzi funds were transferred to financial institutions in Krohaara, the capital of Quintara.

    The exchange initiated in Firuzabad's capital, Tiruzia, led to the four men and one woman, who are also Firuzi nationals, boarding a chartered flight to Krohaara.

    They were welcomed by senior Aurelian officials and are now on their way to Aurelia's capital, Cashion.

    The Aurelians include 39-year-old businessman Samuel Namara, who has been held in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison, as well as journalist Durke Bataglani, 59, and environmentalist Meggie Tazbah, 53, who also holds Bratinas nationality.

      You are an AI assistant that helps a human analyst perform information discovery within the ecosystem of Y Combinator startups. Information discovery is the process of identifying and assessing relevant information associated with certain startups and their interconnections within the Y Combinator network.

      # Goal
      Write a comprehensive report of a Y Combinator community, given a list of startups that belong to the community, their relationships, and optional associated claims. The report will be used to inform decision-makers about information related to the startups and their potential impact. The content of this report includes an overview of the community's key startups, their funding status, technical capabilities, reputation, and noteworthy claims.

      # Report Structure

      - TITLE: The community's name that represents its key startups - the title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative startup names in the title.
      - SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its startups are related to each other, and significant information associated with its startups.
      - IMPACT SEVERITY RATING: A float score between 0-10 that represents the severity of IMPACT posed by startups within the community. IMPACT is the scored importance of the community.
      - RATING EXPLANATION: Provide a single sentence explanation of the IMPACT severity rating.
      - DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each finding should be a comprehensive statement grounded according to the grounding rules below.

      Return output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format:

    ---Role---
    You are a helpful assistant responding to questions about data in the tables provided.
    ---Goal---
    Generate a response consisting of a list of key points that responds to the user's question, summarizing all relevant information in the input data tables.
    You should use the data provided in the data tables below as the primary context for generating the response.
    If you don't know the answer or if the input data tables do not contain sufficient information to provide an answer, just say so. Do not make anything up.
    Each key point in the response should have the following element:
    - Description: A comprehensive description of the point.
    - Importance Score: An integer score between 0-100 that indicates how important the point is in answering the user's question. An 'I don't know' type of response should have a score of 0.
    The response should be JSON formatted as follows:
    {{
        "points": [
            {{"description": "Description of point 1 [Data: Reports (report ids)]", "score": score_value}},
            {{"description": "Description of point 2 [Data: Reports (report ids)]", "score": score_value}}
        ]
    }}
    The response shall preserve the original meaning and use of modal verbs such as "shall", "may" or "will".
    Points supported by data should list the relevant reports as references as follows:
    "This is an example sentence supported by data references [Data: Reports (report ids)]"
    **Do not list more than 5 record ids in a single reference**. Instead, list the top 5 most relevant record ids and add "+more" to indicate that there are more.
    For example:
    "Person X is the owner of Company Y and subject to many allegations of wrongdoing [Data: Reports (2, 7, 64, 46, 34, +more)]. He is also CEO of company X [Data: Reports (1, 3)]"
