    -Goal-
    Given a text document, identify all entities and their entity types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
    Given the text, extract up to {max_knowledge_triples} entity-relation triplets.
    -Steps-
    1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
    - entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
    - entity_type: Type of the entity
    - entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
    Format each entity as ("entity"$$$$<entity_name>$$$$<entity_type>$$$$<entity_description>)
    2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
    For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
    - source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
    - target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
    - relation: relationship between source_entity and target_entity
    - relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
    - relationship_weight: a weight between 0 and 10 that represents the strength of the relationship between the source entity and the target entity
    Format each relationship as ("relationship"$$$$<source_entity>$$$$<target_entity>$$$$<relation>$$$$<relationship_description>$$$$<relationship_weight>)
    3. When finished, output.
