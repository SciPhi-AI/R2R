These methods involve analyzing the genetic information of organisms and comparing them to known species to determine their evolutionary relationships and unique characteristics.\n\n1. DNA barcoding: This technique involves sequencing a specific, standardized region of an organism's DNA, usually the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene in animals or the chloroplast genes rbcL and matK in plants. The DNA barcode serves as a unique identifier for each species, allowing researchers to compare the genetic information of an unknown organism to a database of known species. If the DNA barcode of the unknown organism does not match any known species, it may be considered a new species.\n\n2. Molecular phylogenetics: This approach uses DNA sequences to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among organisms. By comparing the DNA sequences of different species, researchers can identify shared ancestry and create a phylogenetic tree that represents the evolutionary history of the organisms. If an unknown organism's DNA sequence does not fit within any existing group on the phylogenetic tree, it may be considered a new species.\n\n3. Comparative genomics: This method involves comparing the entire genome of an unknown organism to those of known species. By analyzing the similarities and differences in the genetic information, researchers can identify unique genes and other genomic features that may be characteristic of a new species. Additionally, comparative genomics can provide insights into the evolutionary processes that have shaped the genomes of different species, further refining taxonomic classification.\n\n4. Metagenomics: This technique involves sequencing the DNA of entire communities of organisms, such as those found in environmental samples like soil or water. By analyzing the genetic information present in these samples, researchers can identify previously unknown species that may not have been detected using traditional methods, such as morphological analysis.\n\nUsing DNA sequencing to identify new species and improve taxonomic classification has several advantages over traditional methods:\n\n1. Objectivity: DNA sequencing provides a more objective and standardized approach to species identification, reducing the potential for human error and bias in morphological analysis.\n\n2. Resolution: DNA sequencing can reveal genetic differences between closely related species that may be difficult to distinguish based on morphology alone.\n\n3. Speed and efficiency: DNA sequencing technologies have become faster and more affordable, allowing researchers to analyze large numbers of samples and identify new species more quickly than traditional methods.\n\n4. Discovery of cryptic species: DNA sequencing can reveal the existence of cryptic species, which are groups of organisms that are genetically distinct but morphologically indistinguishable from one another.\n\nIn conclusion, DNA sequencing is a powerful tool for identifying new species and improving the accuracy of taxonomic classification. By analyzing the genetic information of organisms, researchers can uncover previously unknown species, refine our understanding of evolutionary relationships, and ultimately enhance our knowledge of biodiversity.`\n\n**Output:**\n```json\n{{\n    \"entities\": {{\n        \"[1]\": \"skill: DNA sequencing\",\n        \"[2]\": \"skill: DNA barcoding\",\n        \"[3]\": \"skill: Molecular phylogenetics\",\n        \"[4]\": \"skill: Comparative genomics\",\n        \"[5]\": \"skill: Metagenomics\",\n        \"[6]\": \"product: mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene\",\n        \"[7]\": \"product: chloroplast genes rbcL and matK\",\n        \"[8]\": \"product: DNA barcode\",\n        \"[9]\": \"product: phylogenetic tree\",\n        \"[10]\": \"product: genome\",\n        \"[11]\": \"product: environmental samples\",\n        \"[12]\": \"skill: morphological analysis\",\n        \"[13]\": \"skill: taxonomic classification\",\n        \"[14]\": \"skill: species identification\",\n        \"[15]\": \"skill: evolutionary relationships\",\n        \"[16]\": \"skill: biodiversity\"\n    }},\n    \"triplets\": [\n        \"[2]: involves: [1]\",\n        \"[2]: uses: [6]\",\n        \"[2]: uses: [7]\",\n        \"[8]: serves as: unique identifier\",\n        \"[3]: uses: [1]\",\n        \"[3]: reconstructs: [15]\",\n        \"[3]: creates: [9]\",\n        \"[4]: involves: [1]\",\n        \"[4]: compares: [10]\",\n        \"[5]: involves: [1]\",\n        \"[5]: sequences: [11]\",\n        \"[1]: improves: [13]\",\n        \"[1]: identifies: new species\",\n        \"[1]: provides: objectivity\",\n        \"[1]: reveals: genetic differences\",\n        \"[1]: increases: speed and efficiency\",\n        \"[1]: discovers: cryptic species\",\n        \"[1]: enhances: [16]\"\n    ]\n}}\n```\n\n### Task:\nYour task is to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) and knowledge graph triplet extraction on the text that follows:\n{input_text}\n\n#### Notes:\n  - Your response must be in valid JSON format with 'entities' and 'triplets' as keys.
