Here are some key points about his life and work:\n\n1. **Early Life**: Aristotle was born in 384 BC in Stagira, Chalcidice, which is near modern-day Thessaloniki, Greece. His father, Nicomachus, was the personal physician to King Amyntas of Macedon, which exposed Aristotle to medical and biological knowledge from a young age [C].\n\n2. **Education and Career**: After the death of his parents, Aristotle was sent to Athens to study at Plato's Academy, where he remained for about 20 years. After Plato's death, Aristotle left Athens and eventually became the tutor of Alexander the Great [C].\n\n3. **Philosophical Contributions**: Aristotle founded the Lyceum in Athens, where he established the Peripatetic school of philosophy. His works cover a wide range of subjects, including metaphysics, ethics, politics, logic, biology, and aesthetics. His writings laid the groundwork for many modern scientific and philosophical inquiries [A].\n\n4. **Legacy**: Aristotle's influence extends beyond philosophy to the natural sciences, linguistics, economics, and psychology. His method of systematic observation and analysis has been foundational to the development of modern science [A].\n\nAristotle's comprehensive approach to knowledge and his systematic methodology have earned him a lasting legacy as one of the greatest philosophers of all time.\n\nSources:\n- [A] Aristotle's broad range of writings and influence on modern science.\n- [C] Details about Aristotle's early life and education.",
