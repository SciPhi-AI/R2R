  Containerized, state of the art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a RESTful API
</h3>

# About
R2R (RAG to Riches) is the most advanced AI retrieval system, supporting Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with production-ready features. Built around a containerized [RESTful API]([https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/api-reference/introduction](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/api-and-sdks/introduction)), R2R offers multimodal content ingestion, hybrid search functionality, configurable GraphRAG, and comprehensive user and document management.

For a more complete view of R2R, check out the [full documentation](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/).

## Key Features
- [**üìÅ Multimodal Ingestion**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/documentation/configuration/ingestion): Parse `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.json`, `.png`, `.mp3`, and more.
- [**üîç Hybrid Search**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/cookbooks/hybrid-search): Combine semantic and keyword search with reciprocal rank fusion for enhanced relevancy.
- [**üîó Knowledge Graphs**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/cookbooks/knowledge-graphs): Automatically extract entities and relationships and build knowledge graphs.
- [**üìä GraphRAG**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/cookbooks/graphrag): Cluster and summarize communities with over your created graphs for even richer insights.
- [**üóÇÔ∏è User Management**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/cookbooks/user-auth): Efficiently manage documents and user roles within R2R.
- [**üî≠ Observability**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/cookbooks/observability): Observe and analyze your RAG engine performance.
- [**üß© Configuration**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/documentation/configuration/overview): Setup your application using intuitive configuration files.
- [**üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/cookbooks/application): An open-source React+Next.js admin dashboard to interact with R2R via GUI.


## [What's New](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/introduction/whats-new)

- Release 3.3.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December 3, 2024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Warning: These changes are breaking!
  - [V3 API Specification](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/api-and-sdks/introduction)

## Install with pip
The recommended way to get started with R2R is by using our CLI.

```bash
pip install r2r
```


You may run R2R directly from the python package, but additional dependencies like Postgres+pgvector must be configured and the full R2R core is required:

```bash
# export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# export POSTGRES...
pip install 'r2r[core,ingestion-bundle]'
r2r --config-name=default serve
```

Alternatively, R2R can be launched alongside its requirements inside Docker:

```bash
# export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
r2r serve --docker --full
```

The command above will install the `full` installation which includes Hatchet for orchestration and Unstructured.io for parsing.
