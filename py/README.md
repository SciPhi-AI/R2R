The Elasticsearch for RAG.

Build, scale, and deploy state of the art Retrieval-Augmented Generation applications.
</h3>

# About
R2R (RAG to Riches), the Elasticsearch for RAG, bridges the gap between experimenting with and deploying state of the art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. It's a complete platform that helps you quickly build and launch scalable RAG solutions. Built around a containerized [RESTful API](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/api-reference/introduction), R2R offers multimodal ingestion support, hybrid search, GraphRAG capabilities, user management, and observability features.

For a more complete view of R2R, check out the [full documentation](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/).

## Key Features
- [**üìÅ Multimodal Ingestion**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/documentation/configuration/ingestion/overview): Parse `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.json`, `.png`, `.mp3`, and more.
- [**üîç Hybrid Search**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/cookbooks/hybrid-search): Combine semantic and keyword search with reciprocal rank fusion for enhanced relevancy.
- [**üîó Graph RAG**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/cookbooks/graphrag): Automatically extract relationships and build knowledge graphs.
- [**üóÇÔ∏è App Management**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/cookbooks/user-auth): Efficiently manage documents and users with full authentication.
- [**üî≠ Observability**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/cookbooks/observability): Observe and analyze your RAG engine performance.
- [**üß© Configurable**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/documentation/configuration/introduction): Provision your application using intuitive configuration files.
- [**üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard**](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R-Dashboard): An open-source React+Next.js app with optional authentication, to interact with R2R via GUI.

  Warning: These changes are breaking! We will be releasing a migration script soon.
  - Orchestration with [Hatchet](https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet)
  - Default ingestion provider set to [Unstructured](https://docs.unstructured.io/welcome)
  - Improved knowledge graph construction process


## Install with pip
The recommended way to get started with R2R is by using our CLI.

```bash
pip install r2r
```

Then, after installing R2R, it is recommended to launch with Docker, if possible:

```bash
# export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
r2r serve --docker
```

Alternatively, you may run R2R directly from the python package, but additional dependencies like Postgres+pgvector must be configured and the full R2R core is required:

```bash
# export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# export POSTGRES...
pip install 'r2r[core]'
r2r --config-name=default serve
```
