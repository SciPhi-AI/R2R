# About
R2R was designed to bridge the gap between local LLM experimentation and scalable, production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. R2R provides a the latest techniques in RAG and is built around a RESTful API for ease of use.

For a more complete view of R2R, check out the [full documentation](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/).

## Key Features
- **üìÅ Multimodal Support**: Ingest files ranging from `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.json` to `.png`, `.mp3`, and more.
- **üîç Hybrid Search**: Combine semantic and keyword search with reciprocal rank fusion for enhanced relevancy.
- **üîó Graph RAG**: Automatically extract relationships and build knowledge graphs.
- **üóÇÔ∏è App Management**: Efficiently manage documents and users with full authentication.
- **üî≠ Observability**: Observe and analyze your RAG engine performance.
- **üß© Configurable**: Provision your application using intuitive configuration files.
- **üîå Extensibility**: Develop your application further with easy builder + factory pattern.
- **üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard**: Use the [R2R Dashboard](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R-Dashboard), an open-source React+Next.js app with optional authentication, to interact with R2R via GUI.


## Install with pip
The recommended way to get started with R2R is by using our CLI.

```bash
pip install r2r
```

Then, after installing R2R, it is recommended to launch with Docker, if possible:

```bash
# export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
r2r serve --docker
```

Alternatively, you may run R2R directly from the python package, but additional dependencies like Postgres+pgvector must be configured:

```bash
# export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# export POSTGRES...
r2r --config-name=default serve
```


## Quickstart
After [installing](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/installation), the [R2R Quickstart](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/quickstart) is your go to for a step-by-step guide to get up and running with R2R in minutes. The guide demonstrates R2R's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system by ingesting sample documents and then showcasing features for search, RAG, logging, analytics, and document management.
