Harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood, establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the body's heat, as Aristotle thought.

For example, he made some of the earliest observations about desalination: he observed early \u2013 and correctly \u2013 that when seawater is heated, freshwater evaporates and that the oceans are then replenished by the cycle of rainfall and river runoff (\"I have proved by experiment that salt water evaporated forms fresh and the vapor does not when it condenses condense into sea water again. \")[60]\n\nBiology",

This gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations, enables it to solve equations as well as check validity, and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms, not just two. [186]\n\nCharles Darwin regarded Aristotle as the most important contributor to the subject of biology. In an 1882 letter he wrote that \"Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods, though in very different ways, but they were mere schoolboys to old Aristotle\". [187][188] Also, in later editions of the book \"On the Origin of Species', Darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as Aristotle;[189] the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles.
