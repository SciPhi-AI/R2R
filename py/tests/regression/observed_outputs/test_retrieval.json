It has a dramatic name, Save Thousands of Lives,\nbecause that's what the proceeds will do.Noora has been saving lives for 7 years. They run programs in\nhospitals in South Asia to teach new mothers how to take care of\ntheir babies once they get home. They're in 165 hospitals now. And\nbecause they know the numbers before and after they start at a new\nhospital, they can measure the impact they have. It is massive.\nFor every 1000 live births, they save 9 babies.This number comes from a study\nof 133,733 families at 28 different\nhospitals that Noora conducted in collaboration with the Better\nBirth team at Ariadne Labs, a joint center for health systems\ninnovation at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan\nSchool of Public Health.Noora is so effective that even if you measure their costs in the\nmost conservative way, by dividing their entire budget by the number\nof lives saved, the cost of saving a life is the lowest I've seen.\n$1,235.For this NFT, they're going to issue a public report tracking how\nthis specific tranche of money is spent, and estimating the number\nof lives saved as a result.NFTs are a new territory, and this way of using them is especially\nnew, but I'm excited about its potential. And I'm excited to see\nwhat happens with this particular auction, because unlike an NFT\nrepresenting something that has already happened,\nthis NFT gets better as the price gets higher.The reserve price was about $2.5 million, because that's what it\ntakes for the name to be accurate: that's what it costs to save\n2000 lives. But the higher the price of this NFT goes, the more\nlives will be saved. What a sentence to be able to write.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n",

With a Shared or Shared Saver Ride, when the first rider requests a ride, our algorithms use the first rider\u2019s destination and attempt to match them with other riders traveling along a similar route. If a match between riders is made, our algorithms re-route the driver to include the pick-up location of the matched rider on the active route. For Shared and Shared Saver Rides, drivers earn a fixed amount based on a number of factors, including the time and distance of the ride, the base fare charged to riders and the level of rider demand. We determine the rider fare based on the predicted time and distance of the ride, the level of rider demand and the likelihood of being able to match additional riders along the given route, and such fare is quoted to the riders prior to their commitment to the ride.
