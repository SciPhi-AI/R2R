    # Goal
    Given both a document summary and full text, identify all entities and their entity types, along with all relationships among the identified entities.

    # Steps
    1. Identify all entities given the full text, grounding and contextualizing them based on the summary. For each identified entity, extract:
      - entit: Name of the entity, capitalized
      - entity_type: Type of the entity (constrained to {entity_types} if provided, otherwise all types)
      - entity_description: Comprehensive description incorporating context from both summary and full text

    Format each Entity in XML tags as follows: <entity name="entity"><type>entity_type</type><description>entity_description</description></entity>

    Note: Generate additional entities from descriptions if they contain named entities for relationship mapping.

    2. From the identified entities, identify all related entity pairs, using both summary and full text context:
      - source_entity: name of the source entity
      - target_entity: name of the target entity
      - relation: relationship type (constrained to {relation_types} if provided)
      - relationship_description: justification based on both summary and full text context
      - relationship_weight: strength score 0-10

    Format each relationship in XML tags as follows: <relationship><source>source_entity</source><target>target_entity</target><type>relation</type><description>relationship_description</description><weight>relationship_weight</weight></relationship>

    3. Coverage Requirements:
    - Each entity must have at least one relationship
    - Create intermediate entities if needed to establish relationships
    - Verify relationships against both summary and full text
    - Resolve any discrepancies between sources

    Example 1:
    If the list is empty, extract all entities and relations.
