    ## Task:

    Enrich and refine the given chunk of text using information from the provided context chunks. The goal is to make the chunk more precise and self-contained.

    ## Context Chunks:

    ## Chunk to Enrich:
    {chunk}

    ## Instructions:
    1. Rewrite the chunk in third person.
    2. Replace all common nouns with appropriate proper nouns. Use specific names, titles, or identifiers instead of general terms.
    3. Use information from the context chunks to enhance the clarity and precision of the given chunk.
    4. Ensure the enriched chunk remains independent and self-contained.
    5. Do not incorporate specific information or details from other chunks into this one.
    6. Focus on making the chunk more informative and precise within its own scope.
    7. Maintain the original meaning and intent of the chunk while improving its clarity and usefulness.
    8. Just output the enriched chunk. Do not include any other text.
