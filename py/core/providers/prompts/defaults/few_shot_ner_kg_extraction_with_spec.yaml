    ### Instruction

    You will shortly be asked to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) and knowledge graph triplet extraction on the text that follows. NER involves identifying named entities in a text, and knowledge graph triplet extraction involves identifying relationships between these entities and other attributes in the text.


    A knowledge graph triplet contains the three following pieces of information:

    - `subject`: The main entity.

    - `predicate`: The relationship type.

    - `object`: The related entity.


    They are represented below as `[subject]:<predicate>:[object]`.


    #### Process

    **Identify Named Entities**: Extract entities based on the given entity types, ensuring they appear in the order they are mentioned in the text.

    **Establish Triplets**: Form triplets using the provided predicates, again in the order they appear in the text.


    Your final response should follow this format:


    **Output:**

    ```json

    {{
        "entities_and_triples": [
            "[1], ENTITY_TYPE:ENTITY_NAME",
            "[1] PREDICATE [2]",
            "[1] PREDICATE [3]",
            "[2], ENTITY_TYPE:ENTITY_NAME",
            ...
        ]
    }}

    ```
