    -Goal-
    Given a text document, identify all entities and their entity types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
    Given the text, extract up to {max_knowledge_triples} entity-relation triplets.
    -Steps-
    1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
    - entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
    - entity_type: Type of the entity. If the list below is not empty, only extract entities of the given types. If this list is empty, extract all entities.
    {entity_types}
    - entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities that is explicitly mentioned in the text.
    Format each entity as ("entity"$$$$<entity_name>$$$$<entity_type>$$$$<entity_description>).
    Output additional entities based on the entity_description if they contain more named entities. You will later use this to create relationships between them.
    2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
    For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
    - source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
    - target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
    - relation: relationship between source_entity and target_entity. If the list below is not empty, only extract relations of the given types. If this list is empty, extract all relations.
    {relation_types}
    - relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
    - relationship_weight: a weight between 0 and 10 that represents the strength of the relationship between the source entity and the target entity
    Format each relationship as ("relationship"$$$$<source_entity>$$$$<target_entity>$$$$<relation>$$$$<relationship_description>$$$$<relationship_weight>)
    3. Make sure that each entity has at least one relationship. If you are not able to find a relationship from the pair of entities above, first create a new entity based on the source entity description and then create a relationship connecting them.
       Again, make sure that each entity has at least one relationship. If you don't do this, you will be fired.
    3. When finished, output in the format in as given in the examples below. Do not repeat the same entity or relationship multiple times.

    Example 1:
    If the list is empty, extract all entities and relations.

    TechGlobal's (TG) stock skyrocketed in its opening day on the Global Exchange Thursday. But IPO experts warn that the semiconductor corporation's debut on the public markets isn't indicative of how other newly listed companies may perform.

    TechGlobal, a formerly public company, was taken private by Vision Holdings in 2014. The well-established chip designer says it powers 85% of premium smartphones.

    Five Aurelians jailed for 8 years in Firuzabad and widely regarded as hostages are on their way home to Aurelia.

    The swap orchestrated by Quintara was finalized when $8bn of Firuzi funds were transferred to financial institutions in Krohaara, the capital of Quintara.

    The exchange initiated in Firuzabad's capital, Tiruzia, led to the four men and one woman, who are also Firuzi nationals, boarding a chartered flight to Krohaara.

    They were welcomed by senior Aurelian officials and are now on their way to Aurelia's capital, Cashion.

    The Aurelians include 39-year-old businessman Samuel Namara, who has been held in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison, as well as journalist Durke Bataglani, 59, and environmentalist Meggie Tazbah, 53, who also holds Bratinas nationality.
