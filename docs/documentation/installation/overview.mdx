# R2R Installation

Welcome to the R2R installation guide. R2R offers powerful features for your RAG applications, including:

- **Flexibility**: Run with cloud-based LLMs or entirely on your local machine
- **State-of-the-Art**: Advanced RAG techniques like hybrid search, GraphRAG, and agentic RAG

## Choose Your Installation Method

<Tip>
SciPhi Cloud includes a generous free tier and is the quickest way to get up and running with R2R. Check out the [documentation here](/sciphi-cloud/deploy) to skip the local installation!
</Tip>

If you're new to R2R or want to get started quickly, we recommend the Docker installation. Local installation is supported on a best-effort basis.
