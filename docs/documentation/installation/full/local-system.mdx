# R2R Local System Installation

This guide will walk you through installing and running R2R on your local system without using Docker. This method allows for more customization and control over individual components.


<Tip>
  Local installation of R2R Core is challenging due to the numerous services it integrates. We strongly recommend using Docker to get started quickly.

  If you choose to proceed with a local installation, be prepared to set up and configure the following services:

  1. **Postgres with pgvector**: A relational database with vector storage capabilities.
  2. **Unstructured.io**: A complex system for file ingestion.
  4. **Hatchet**: A RabbitMQ-based orchestration system.

  Alternatively, you can use cloud versions of these services, but you'll be responsible for enrolling in them and providing the necessary environment variables.

  Each of these components has its own requirements, potential compatibility issues, and configuration complexities. Debugging issues in a local setup can be significantly more challenging than using a pre-configured Docker environment.

</Tip>

  Unless you have a specific need for a local installation and are comfortable with advanced system configuration, we highly recommend using the Docker setup method for a smoother experience.
## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed and/or available in the cloud:
- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git
- Postgres + pgvector
- Unstructured file ingestion
- Hatchet workflow orchestration

## Install the R2R CLI & Python SDK

First, install the R2R CLI and Python SDK:

```bash
pip install 'r2r[core ingestion-bundle hatchet]'
```

## Environment Setup

R2R requires connections to various services. Set up the following environment variables based on your needs:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cloud LLM Providers" icon="language">
    Note, cloud providers are optional as R2R can be run entirely locally.
     ```bash
      # Set cloud LLM settings
      export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
      # export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
      # ...
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hatchet" icon="axe">
    R2R uses [Hatchet](https://docs.hatchet.run/home) for orchestration. When building R2R locally, you will need to either (a) register for [Hatchet's cloud service](https://cloud.onhatchet.run/auth/login/) or (b) install it [locally following their instructions](https://docs.hatchet.run/self-hosting/docker-compose), or (c) deploy the R2R docker and connect with the internally provisioned Hatchet service.
     ```bash
      # Set cloud LLM settings
      export HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN=...
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Postgres+pgvector" icon="database">
     With R2R you can connect to your own instance of Postgres+pgvector or a remote cloud instance.
     ```bash
      # Set Postgres+pgvector settings
      export R2R_POSTGRES_USER=$YOUR_POSTGRES_USER
      export R2R_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD
      export R2R_POSTGRES_HOST=$YOUR_POSTGRES_HOST
      export R2R_POSTGRES_PORT=$YOUR_POSTGRES_PORT
      export R2R_POSTGRES_DBNAME=$YOUR_POSTGRES_DBNAME
      export R2R_PROJECT_NAME=$YOUR_PROJECT_NAME # see note below
    ```
    <Note>
    The `R2R_PROJECT_NAME` environment variable defines the tables within your Postgres database where the selected R2R project resides. If the specified tables do not exist then they will be created by R2R during initialization.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unstructured" icon="puzzle">
  By default, R2R uses [unstructured.io](https://docs.unstructured.io/welcome) to handle file ingestion. Unstructured can be:

  1. Installed locally by following their [documented instructions](https://docs.unstructured.io/open-source/introduction/overview)
  2. Connected to via the cloud

  For cloud connections, set the following environment variable:

  ```bash
  # Set Unstructured API key for cloud usage
  export UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```

  Alternatively, R2R has its own lightweight end-to-end ingestion, which may be more appropriate in some situations. This can be specified in your server configuration by choosing `r2r` as your ingestion provider.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Running R2R

<Note>The full R2R installation does not use the default [`r2r.toml`](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R/blob/main/py/r2r.toml), instead it provides overrides through a pre-built custom configuration, [`full.toml`](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R/blob/main/py/core/configs/full.toml).</Note>

After setting up your environment, you can start R2R using the following command:

```bash
# requires services for unstructured, hatchet, postgres
r2r serve --config-name=full
```

For local LLM usage:

```bash
r2r serve --config-name=full_local_llm
```

## Python Development Mode

For those looking to develop R2R locally:

1. Install Poetry: Follow instructions on the [official Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

2. Clone and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:SciPhi-AI/R2R.git
   cd R2R/py
   poetry install -E "core ingestion-bundle hatchet"
   ```

3. Setup environment:
   Follow the steps listed in the Environment Setup section above. Additionally, you may introduce a local .env file to make development easier, and you can customize your local `r2r.toml` to suit your specific needs.

4. Start your server:
  ```bash
  poetry run r2r serve --config-name=core
  ```

## Next Steps

After successfully installing R2R:

1. **Verify Installation**: Ensure all components are running correctly by accessing the R2R API at http://localhost:7272/v2/health.

2. **Quick Start**: Follow our [R2R Quickstart Guide](/documentation/quickstart) to set up your first RAG application.

3. **In-Depth Tutorial**: For a more comprehensive understanding, work through our [R2R Walkthrough](/cookbooks/walkthrough).

4. **Customize Your Setup**: Configure R2R components with the [Configuration Guide](/documentation/configuration).

If you encounter any issues during installation or setup, please use our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/p6KqD2kjtB) or [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R) to seek assistance.
