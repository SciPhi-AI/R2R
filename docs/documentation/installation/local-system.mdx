# R2R Local System Installation

This guide will walk you through installing and running R2R on your local system without using Docker. This method allows for more customization and control over individual components.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

## Install the R2R CLI & Python SDK

First, install the R2R CLI and Python SDK:

```bash
pip install r2r
```

## Environment Setup

R2R requires connections to various services. Set up the following environment variables based on your needs:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cloud LLM Providers" icon="language">
    Note, cloud providers are optional as R2R can be run entirely locally.
     ```bash
      # Set cloud LLM settings
      export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
      # export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
      # ...
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hatchet" icon="axe">
    R2R uses Hatchet for orchestration. When building R2R locally, you will need to either (a) register for [Hatchet's cloud service](https://cloud.onhatchet.run/auth/login/) or (b) install it [locally following their instructions](https://docs.hatchet.run/self-hosting/docker-compose), or (c) deploy the R2R docker and connect with the internally provisioned Hatchet service.
     ```bash
      # Set cloud LLM settings
      export HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN=...
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Postgres+pgvector" icon="database">
     With R2R you can connect to your own instance of Postgres+pgvector or a remote cloud instance.
     ```bash
      # Set Postgres+pgvector settings
      export POSTGRES_USER=$YOUR_POSTGRES_USER
      export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD
      export POSTGRES_HOST=$YOUR_POSTGRES_HOST
      export POSTGRES_PORT=$YOUR_POSTGRES_PORT
      export POSTGRES_DBNAME=$YOUR_POSTGRES_DBNAME
      export POSTGRES_VECS_COLLECTION=$YOUR_VECS_COLLECTION # see note below
    ```
    <Note>
    The `POSTGRES_VECS_COLLECTION` environment variable defines the collection within your Postgres database where R2R related tables reside. If the specified collection does not exist then it will be created by R2R during initialization.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Neo4j" icon="chart-simple">
     Use your own local instance of Neo4j.
     ```bash
      # Set Neo4j settings
      export NEO4J_USER=$YOUR_NEO4J_USER
      export NEO4J_PASSWORD=$YOUR_NEO4J_PASSWORD
      export NEO4J_URL=$YOUR_NEO4J_URL
      export NEO4J_DATABASE=$YOUR_NEO4J_DATABASE
    ```
    Refer [here for basic setup help](/other/neo4j-setup).
  </Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unstructured" icon="puzzle">
  By default, R2R uses [unstructured.io](https://docs.unstructured.io/welcome) to handle file ingestion. Unstructured can be:

  1. Installed locally by following their [documented instructions](https://docs.unstructured.io/open-source/introduction/overview)
  2. Connected to via the cloud

  For cloud connections, set the following environment variable:

  ```bash
  # Set Unstructured API key for cloud usage
  export UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```

  Alternatively, R2R has its own lightweight end-to-end ingestion, which may be more appropriate in some situations. This can be specified in your server configuration by choosing `r2r` as your ingestion provider.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Python Development Mode

For those looking to develop R2R locally:

1. Install Poetry: Follow instructions on the [official Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

2. Clone and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:SciPhi-AI/R2R.git
   cd R2R/py
   poetry install -E core
   poetry run download-nltk-data
   ```

3. Setup environment:
   Follow the steps listed in the Environment Setup section above. Additionally, you may introduce a local .env file to make development easier, and you can customize your local `r2r.toml` to suit your specific needs.

4. Run methods individually as needed for development:
  ```bash
  # e.g. Run the server
  poetry run r2r serve

  # in a separate window
  poetry run r2r ingest-sample-file
  ```

## Running R2R

After setting up your environment, you can start R2R using the following command:

```bash
# requires full unstructured installation
r2r serve --config-name=default
```

For local LLM usage:

```bash
r2r serve --config-name=local_llm
```

## Next Steps

After successfully installing R2R:

1. **Verify Installation**: Ensure all components are running correctly by accessing the R2R API at http://localhost:7272/v2/health.

2. **Quick Start**: Follow our [R2R Quickstart Guide](/documentation/quickstart) to set up your first RAG application.

3. **In-Depth Tutorial**: For a more comprehensive understanding, work through our [R2R Walkthrough](/cookbooks/walkthrough).

4. **Customize Your Setup**: Configure R2R components with the [Configuration Guide](/documentation/configuration).
