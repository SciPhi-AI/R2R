# R2R CLI Documentation

## Installation

Before starting, make sure you have completed the [R2R installation](/documentation/installation).

The R2R CLI is automatically installed as part of the R2R Python package. No additional installation steps are required.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure R2R is running correctly by checking the health status:

```bash
r2r health
```

You should see output similar to:
```
{"status":"ok"}
```

2. Ingest a sample file to test the ingestion process:

```bash
r2r ingest-sample-file
```

This will download and ingest a sample text file from the R2R GitHub repository. You can verify the ingestion was successful by checking the documents overview:

```bash
r2r documents-overview
```

3. Perform a search on the ingested document:

```bash
r2r search --query "What did Aristotle contribute to philosophy?"
```

This will search the ingested document for relevant information to answer the query.

4. Generate a response using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):

```bash
r2r rag --query "What were Aristotle's main contributions to logic?"
```

This will perform a search on the ingested document and use the retrieved information to generate a complete response to the query.
