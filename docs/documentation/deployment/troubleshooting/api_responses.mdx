# Troubleshooting Guide: Unexpected R2R API Responses

When working with the R2R API, you might encounter responses that don't match your expectations. This guide will help you diagnose and resolve common issues related to unexpected API behavior.

## 1. Verify API Endpoint and Request

First, ensure you're using the correct API endpoint and making the proper request.

### 1.1 Check API URL

- Confirm you're using the correct base URL for your R2R instance.
- Verify the endpoint path is correct (e.g., `/v2/search` for search requests).

### 1.2 Review Request Method

- Ensure you're using the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for the endpoint.

### 1.3 Validate Request Headers

- Check that you've included all required headers, especially:
  - `Content-Type: application/json` for POST requests
  - Authorization header if required

### 1.4 Inspect Request Body

- For POST requests, verify the JSON structure of your request body.
- Ensure all required fields are present and correctly formatted.

## 2. Common Unexpected Responses

### 2.1 Empty Results

**Symptom:** API returns an empty list or no results when you expect data.

**Possible Causes:**
- No matching data in the database
- Incorrect search parameters
- Issues with data ingestion

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Verify your search query or filter parameters.
2. Check if the data you're expecting has been successfully ingested.
3. Try a broader search to see if any results are returned.

### 2.2 Incorrect Data Format

**Symptom:** API returns data in an unexpected format or structure.

**Possible Causes:**
- Changes in API version
- Misconfiguration in R2R settings

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check the API documentation for the correct response format.
2. Verify you're using the latest version of the API.
3. Review your R2R configuration settings.

### 2.3 Unexpected Error Responses

**Symptom:** API returns error codes or messages you don't expect.

**Possible Causes:**
- Server-side issues
- Rate limiting
- Authorization problems

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check the error message for specific details.
2. Verify your API key or authentication token.
3. Ensure you're not exceeding rate limits.
4. Check R2R server logs for more information.

## 3. Debugging Techniques

### 3.1 Use Verbose Logging

Enable verbose logging in your API requests to get more detailed information:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('http://your-r2r-api-url/v2/endpoint',
                        params={'verbose': True})
print(response.json())
```

### 3.2 Check R2R Server Logs

Access the R2R server logs to look for any error messages or warnings:

```bash
docker logs r2r-container-name
```

### 3.3 Use API Testing Tools

Utilize tools like Postman or cURL to isolate API issues:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://your-r2r-api-url/v2/health" -H "accept: application/json"
```

## 4. Common Issues and Solutions

### 4.1 Inconsistent Search Results

**Issue:** Search results vary unexpectedly between requests.

**Solution:**
- Check if your data is being updated concurrently.
- Verify the consistency of your vector database (Postgres+pgvector).
- Ensure your search parameters are consistent.

### 4.2 Slow API Response Times

**Issue:** API requests take longer than expected to return results.

**Solution:**
- Check the size of your dataset and consider optimization.
- Verify the performance of your database queries.
- Consider scaling your R2R deployment if dealing with large datasets.

### 4.3 Unexpected Data Relationships

**Issue:** API returns relationships between data that don't match expectations.

**Solution:**
- Review your knowledge graph structure in Neo4j.
- Check the logic in your data ingestion and relationship creation processes.
- Verify that your query is correctly traversing the graph.
