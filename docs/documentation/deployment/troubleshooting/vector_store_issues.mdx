# Troubleshooting Guide: Vector Storage Problems in R2R

Vector storage is a crucial component in R2R (RAG to Riches) for efficient similarity searches. This guide focuses on troubleshooting common vector storage issues, particularly with Postgres and pgvector.

## 1. Connection Issues

### Symptom: R2R can't connect to the vector database

1. **Check Postgres Connection:**
   ```bash
   psql -h localhost -U your_username -d your_database
   ```
   If this fails, the issue might be with Postgres itself, not specifically vector storage.

2. **Verify Environment Variables:**
   Ensure these are correctly set in your R2R configuration:
   - `POSTGRES_USER`
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
   - `POSTGRES_HOST`
   - `POSTGRES_PORT`
   - `POSTGRES_DBNAME`
   - `POSTGRES_PROJECT_NAME`

3. **Check Docker Network:**
   If using Docker, ensure the R2R and Postgres containers are on the same network:
   ```bash
   docker network inspect r2r-network
   ```

## 2. pgvector Extension Issues

### Symptom: "extension pgvector does not exist" error

1. **Check if pgvector is Installed:**
   Connect to your database and run:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector';
   ```

2. **Install pgvector:**
   If not installed, run:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION vector;
   ```

3. **Verify Postgres Version:**
   pgvector requires Postgres 11 or later. Check your version:
   ```sql
   SELECT version();
   ```

## 3. Vector Dimension Mismatch

### Symptom: Error inserting vectors or during similarity search

1. **Check Vector Dimensions:**
   Verify the dimension of vectors you're trying to insert matches your schema:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name = 'your_vector_table' AND data_type = 'vector';
   ```

2. **Verify R2R Configuration:**
   Ensure the vector dimension in your R2R configuration matches your database schema.

3. **Recreate Table with Correct Dimensions:**
   If dimensions are mismatched, you may need to recreate the table:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE your_vector_table;
   CREATE TABLE your_vector_table (id bigserial PRIMARY KEY, embedding vector(384));
   ```

## 4. Performance Issues

### Symptom: Slow similarity searches

1. **Check Index:**
   Ensure you have an appropriate index:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX ON your_vector_table USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
   ```

2. **Analyze Table:**
   Run ANALYZE to update statistics:
   ```sql
   ANALYZE your_vector_table;
   ```

3. **Monitor Query Performance:**
   Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to check query execution plans:
   ```sql
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM your_vector_table
   ORDER BY embedding <=> '[your_vector]' LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. **Adjust Work Memory:**
   If dealing with large vectors, increase work_mem:
   ```sql
   SET work_mem = '1GB';
   ```

## 5. Data Integrity Issues

### Symptom: Unexpected search results or missing data

1. **Check Vector Normalization:**
   Ensure vectors are normalized before insertion if using cosine similarity.

2. **Verify Data Insertion:**
   Check if data is being correctly inserted:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_vector_table;
   ```

3. **Inspect Random Samples:**
   Look at some random entries to ensure data quality:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM your_vector_table ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 10;
   ```

## 6. Disk Space Issues

### Symptom: Insertion failures or database unresponsiveness

1. **Check Disk Space:**
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

2. **Monitor Postgres Disk Usage:**
   ```sql
   SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('your_database'));
   ```

3. **Identify Large Tables:**
   ```sql
   SELECT relname, pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(relid))
   FROM pg_catalog.pg_statio_user_tables
   ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(relid) DESC;
   ```

## 7. Backup and Recovery

If all else fails, you may need to restore from a backup:

1. **Create a Backup:**
   ```bash
   pg_dump -h localhost -U your_username -d your_database > backup.sql
   ```

2. **Restore from Backup:**
   ```bash
   psql -h localhost -U your_username -d your_database < backup.sql
   ```

## Getting Further Help

If these steps don't resolve your issue:

1. Check R2R logs for more detailed error messages.
2. Consult the [pgvector documentation](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) for advanced troubleshooting.
3. Reach out to the R2R community or support channels with detailed information about your setup and the steps you've tried.

Remember to always backup your data before making significant changes to your database or vector storage configuration.
