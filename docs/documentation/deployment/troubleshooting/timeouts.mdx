# R2R Troubleshooting Guide: Connection Timeouts

Connection timeouts can occur at various points in an R2R deployment, affecting different components and services. This guide will help you identify, diagnose, and resolve connection timeout issues.

## 1. Identifying Connection Timeouts

Connection timeouts typically manifest as:
- Slow or unresponsive API calls
- Error messages mentioning "timeout" or "connection refused"
- Services failing to start or becoming unhealthy
- Incomplete data processing or retrieval

## 2. Common Causes of Connection Timeouts

1. Network issues
2. Misconfigured firewall rules
3. Overloaded services
4. Incorrect connection settings
5. DNS resolution problems
6. Service dependencies not ready

## 3. Diagnosing Connection Timeouts

### 3.1 Check Service Health

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

Look for services in an unhealthy or exit state.

### 3.2 Inspect Service Logs

```bash
docker-compose logs <service_name>
```

Search for timeout-related error messages.

### 3.3 Network Connectivity Test

Test network connectivity between services:

```bash
docker-compose exec <service_name> ping <target_service>
```

### 3.4 Check Resource Usage

Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage:

```bash
docker stats
```

## 4. Resolving Common Connection Timeout Issues

### 4.1 R2R API Timeouts

If the R2R API is timing out:

1. Check the R2R service logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs r2r
   ```

2. Verify the R2R service is healthy:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec r2r curl -f http://localhost:7272/v2/health
   ```

3. Increase the timeout settings in your R2R configuration file.

### 4.2 Database Connection Timeouts

For Postgres or Neo4j connection issues:

1. Verify database service is running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps postgres
   docker-compose ps neo4j
   ```

2. Check database logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs postgres
   docker-compose logs neo4j
   ```

3. Ensure correct connection strings in R2R configuration.

4. Increase connection pool size or timeout settings.

### 4.3 Hatchet Engine Timeouts

If Hatchet Engine is experiencing timeouts:

1. Check Hatchet Engine logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs hatchet-engine
   ```

2. Verify RabbitMQ is running and accessible:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec hatchet-rabbitmq rabbitmqctl status
   ```

3. Increase Hatchet client timeout settings in R2R configuration.

### 4.4 Ollama LLM Timeouts

For timeouts related to Ollama:

1. Check Ollama service status:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps ollama
   ```

2. Verify Ollama logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs ollama
   ```

3. Ensure Ollama models are properly loaded:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec ollama ollama list
   ```

4. Increase LLM timeout settings in R2R configuration.

## 5. Advanced Troubleshooting

### 5.1 Network Diagnostics

Use network diagnostic tools within containers:

```bash
docker-compose exec r2r sh -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y iputils-ping net-tools"
docker-compose exec r2r netstat -tuln
```

### 5.2 DNS Resolution

Check DNS resolution within containers:

```bash
docker-compose exec r2r nslookup postgres
```

### 5.3 Firewall Rules

Verify firewall settings on the host machine:

```bash
sudo iptables -L
```

Ensure necessary ports are open for inter-container communication.

### 5.4 Docker Network Inspection

Inspect the Docker network:

```bash
docker network inspect r2r-network
```

Verify all services are properly connected to the network.

## 6. Preventive Measures

1. Implement robust health checks for all services.
2. Use appropriate timeout and retry mechanisms in your application code.
3. Monitor system resources and scale services as needed.
4. Regularly update and maintain all components of your R2R deployment.
5. Implement logging and monitoring solutions for early detection of issues.

## 7. Seeking Further Assistance

If connection timeout issues persist:

1. Collect comprehensive logs from all services.
2. Document the steps you've taken to troubleshoot.
3. Check the R2R documentation and community forums for similar issues.
4. Consider reaching out to the R2R support channels or community for specialized assistance.

Remember to provide detailed information about your deployment environment, configuration settings, and the specific timeout scenarios you're encountering when seeking help.

By following this guide, you should be able to diagnose and resolve most connection timeout issues in your R2R deployment. If problems persist, don't hesitate to seek additional support from the R2R community or professional services.
