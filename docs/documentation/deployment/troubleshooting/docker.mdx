# Troubleshooting Guide: Docker Containers Failing to Start

When Docker containers fail to start, it can be frustrating and halt your development process. This guide will help you diagnose and resolve common issues.

## 1. Check Container Status

First, check the status of your containers:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

Look for containers with a status of "Exited" or "Created" but not "Up".

## 2. View Container Logs

For containers that failed to start, view the logs:

```bash
docker logs <container_id_or_name>
```

Look for error messages that might indicate why the container failed to start.

## 3. Common Issues and Solutions

### 3.1 Port Conflicts

**Symptom:** Error message about ports already in use.

**Solution:**
- Check if the port is already in use by another process:
  ```bash
  sudo lsof -i :<port_number>
  ```
- Change the port mapping in your Docker run command or docker-compose file.

### 3.2 Missing Environment Variables

**Symptom:** Container exits immediately, logs show errors about missing environment variables.

**Solution:**
- Ensure all required environment variables are set in your Docker run command or docker-compose file.
- Double-check your .env file if you're using one.

### 3.3 Insufficient System Resources

**Symptom:** Container fails to start, logs mention memory or CPU limits.

**Solution:**
- Check your system resources:
  ```bash
  docker info
  ```
- Adjust resource limits in Docker settings or in your container configuration.

### 3.4 Image Not Found

**Symptom:** Error message about the image not being found.

**Solution:**
- Ensure the image exists locally or is accessible from the specified registry:
  ```bash
  docker images
  ```
- Pull the image manually if needed:
  ```bash
  docker pull <image_name>:<tag>
  ```

### 3.5 Volume Mount Issues

**Symptom:** Errors related to volume mounts or missing files.

**Solution:**
- Verify that the paths for volume mounts exist on the host system.
- Check permissions on the host directories.

### 3.6 Network Issues

**Symptom:** Container can't connect to other services or the internet.

**Solution:**
- Check Docker network settings:
  ```bash
  docker network ls
  docker network inspect <network_name>
  ```
- Ensure the container is connected to the correct network.

## 4. Debugging Steps

If the above solutions don't resolve the issue:

1. **Run the container in interactive mode:**
   ```bash
   docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash <image_name>
   ```
   This allows you to explore the container environment.

2. **Check container health:**
   If your container has a HEALTHCHECK instruction, review its status:
   ```bash
   docker inspect --format='{{json .State.Health}}' <container_name>
   ```

3. **Review Dockerfile:**
   Ensure your Dockerfile is correctly configured, especially the CMD or ENTRYPOINT instructions.

4. **Verify dependencies:**
   Make sure all required dependencies are installed and correctly configured in the image.

## 5. Advanced Troubleshooting

### 5.1 Docker Daemon Logs

Check Docker daemon logs for system-level issues:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u docker.service
```

### 5.2 Docker Events

Monitor Docker events in real-time:

```bash
docker events
```

### 5.3 Resource Constraints

Review and adjust resource constraints:

```bash
docker update --cpu-shares 512 --memory 512M <container_name>
```

## 6. Seeking Help

If you're still stuck:

1. Gather all relevant logs and configuration files.
2. Check Docker documentation and community forums.
3. If using a specific service (like R2R), consult their support channels or documentation.
4. Consider posting a detailed question on Stack Overflow or Docker community forums.

Remember to always provide:
- Docker version (`docker version`)
- Host OS and version
- Detailed error messages
- Steps to reproduce the issue

By following this guide, you should be able to diagnose and resolve most issues with Docker containers failing to start. If problems persist, don't hesitate to seek help from the Docker community or relevant support channels.
