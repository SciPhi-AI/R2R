# Troubleshooting Guide: Connection String Errors in R2R Deployments

Connection string errors can occur when R2R is unable to establish a connection with a database or service. This guide will help you diagnose and resolve common connection string issues.

## 1. Identify the Error

First, locate the specific error message in your logs. Common connection string errors include:

- "Unable to connect to [service]"
- "Connection refused"
- "Authentication failed"
- "Invalid connection string"

## 2. Common Issues and Solutions

### 2.1 Incorrect Host or Port

**Symptom:** Error messages mentioning "host not found" or "connection refused"

**Possible Causes:**
- Typo in hostname or IP address
- Wrong port number
- Firewall blocking the connection

**Solutions:**
1. Double-check the hostname/IP and port in your connection string
2. Verify the service is running on the specified port
3. Check firewall rules and ensure the port is open

Example fix for PostgreSQL:
```
# Before
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@wronghost:5432/dbname

# After
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@correcthost:5432/dbname
```

### 2.2 Authentication Failures

**Symptom:** Errors like "authentication failed" or "access denied"

**Possible Causes:**
- Incorrect username or password
- User lacks necessary permissions

**Solutions:**
1. Verify username and password are correct
2. Ensure the user has the required permissions on the database

Example fix for Neo4j:
```
# Before
NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/wrongpassword

# After
NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/correctpassword
```

### 2.3 Invalid Connection String Format

**Symptom:** Errors mentioning "invalid connection string" or specific syntax errors

**Possible Causes:**
- Malformed connection string
- Missing required parameters

**Solutions:**
1. Check the connection string format for the specific service
2. Ensure all required parameters are included

Example fix for a generic connection string:
```
# Before (missing password)
CONNECTION_STRING=Service=MyService;User ID=myuser;Server=myserver

# After
CONNECTION_STRING=Service=MyService;User ID=myuser;Password=mypassword;Server=myserver
```

### 2.4 SSL/TLS Issues

**Symptom:** Errors related to SSL handshake or certificate validation

**Possible Causes:**
- SSL/TLS not properly configured
- Invalid or expired certificates

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure SSL/TLS is correctly set up on both client and server
2. Update expired certificates
3. If testing, you may temporarily disable SSL (not recommended for production)

Example fix for PostgreSQL with SSL:
```
# Before (SSL enforced)
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/dbname?sslmode=require

# After (disable SSL for testing only)
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/dbname?sslmode=disable
```

### 2.5 Database Not Found

**Symptom:** Errors like "database does not exist" or "unknown database"

**Possible Causes:**
- Typo in database name
- Database hasn't been created

**Solutions:**
1. Verify the database name is correct
2. Ensure the database exists on the server

Example fix:
```
# Before
POSTGRES_DBNAME=wrongdbname

# After
POSTGRES_DBNAME=correctdbname
```

## 3. Environment-Specific Troubleshooting

### 3.1 Docker Environment

If you're using Docker:

1. Check if the service containers are running:
   ```
   docker ps
   ```
2. Inspect the network to ensure services are on the same network:
   ```
   docker network inspect r2r-network
   ```
3. Use Docker's DNS for hostnames (e.g., use `postgres` instead of `localhost` if `postgres` is the service name)

### 3.2 Cloud Environments

For cloud deployments:

1. Verify that the database service is in the same region/zone as your application
2. Check VPC and subnet configurations
3. Ensure necessary firewall rules or security groups are set up correctly

## 4. Debugging Steps

1. **Test the connection independently:**
   Use command-line tools to test the connection outside of R2R:
   - For PostgreSQL: `psql -h <host> -U <username> -d <dbname>`
   - For Neo4j: `cypher-shell -a <host>:<port> -u <username> -p <password>`

2. **Check service logs:**
   Examine logs of the service you're trying to connect to for any error messages or access attempts.

3. **Use connection string builders:**
   Many database providers offer online tools to help construct valid connection strings.

## 5. Prevention and Best Practices

1. Use environment variables for sensitive information in connection strings
2. Implement connection pooling to manage connections efficiently
3. Set up proper logging to quickly identify connection issues
4. Use secret management services for storing and retrieving connection credentials securely

## 6. Seeking Further Help

If you're still encountering issues:

1. Check R2R documentation for specific connection string requirements
2. Consult the documentation of the specific database or service you're connecting to
3. Search or ask for help in R2R community forums or support channels
4. Provide detailed error messages and environment information when seeking help

Remember to never share actual passwords or sensitive information when asking for help. Always use placeholders in examples.

By following this guide, you should be able to resolve most connection string errors in your R2R deployment. If problems persist, don't hesitate to seek help from the R2R community or support team.
