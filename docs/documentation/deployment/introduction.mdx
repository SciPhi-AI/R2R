# Deploying R2R

R2R (RAG to Riches) is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing deployment in various environments. This guide provides an overview of deployment options and resource recommendations to help you get started with R2R in a production setting.

## Deployment Options

1. **Local Docker or Local Build**: Ideal for development and testing. [Start here](/documentation/installation/overview).
2. **Single Cloud Instance**: Recommended for most small to medium-sized organizations.
3. **Container Orchestration** (Docker Swarm): Suitable for larger organizations or those requiring more granular resource control

## Resource Recommendations

When running R2R, we recommend:
- At least 4 vCPU cores
- 8+GB of RAM (16GB preferred)
- 50gb + 4x raw data size (_size of data to be ingested after converting to TXT_) of disk space

## Deployment Guides

For detailed, step-by-step instructions on deploying R2R in various environments, please refer to our specific deployment guides:
