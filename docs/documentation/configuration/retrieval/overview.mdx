## Introduction

Retrieval in R2R is a sophisticated system that leverages ingested data to provide powerful search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. It combines vector-based semantic search, knowledge graph querying, and language model generation to deliver accurate and contextually relevant results.

## Key Configuration Areas

To configure the retrieval system in R2R, you'll need to focus on several areas in your `r2r.toml` file:

```toml
[database]
provider = "postgres"

[embedding]
provider = "litellm"
base_model = "openai/text-embedding-3-small"
base_dimension = 512
batch_size = 128
add_title_as_prefix = false
rerank_model = "None"
concurrent_request_limit = 256

[kg]
provider = "None"

[completion]
provider = "litellm"
concurrent_request_limit = 16

[completion.generation_config]
model = "openai/gpt-4"
temperature = 0.1
top_p = 1
max_tokens_to_sample = 1_024
stream = false
```

These settings directly impact how R2R performs retrieval operations:

- The `[database]` section configures the vector database used for semantic search.
- The `[embedding]` section defines the model and parameters for converting text into vector embeddings.
- The `[kg]` section, when configured, enables knowledge graph-based retrieval.
- The `[completion]` section sets up the language model used for generating responses in the RAG pipeline.

## Customization and Advanced Features

R2R's retrieval system is highly customizable, allowing you to:

- Implement hybrid search combining vector-based and knowledge graph queries
- Customize search filters, limits, and query generation
- Add custom pipes to the search and RAG pipelines
- Implement reranking for improved result relevance

## Pipeline Architecture

Retrieval in R2R is implemented as a pipeline and consists of the main components shown below:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Query] --> B[RAG Pipeline]
    B --> C[Search Pipeline]
    B --> D[RAG Generation Pipeline]
    C --> E[Vector Search]
    C --> F[Knowledge Graph Search]
    E --> G[Search Results]
    F --> G
    G --> D
    D --> H[Generated Response]
```


## Next Steps

To dive deeper into configuring and optimizing R2R's retrieval capabilities, explore the following sections:

1. [Vector Search](documentation/configuration/retrieval/vector-search)
2. [Knowledge Graph Search](documentation/configuration/retrieval/knowledge-graph)
3. [LLMs](documentation/configuration/retrieval/llm)
2. [RAG](documentation/configuration/retrieval/rag)

By fine-tuning these components, you can tailor R2R's retrieval system to your specific use case, ensuring efficient and accurate information retrieval and generation.
