## Introduction

This guide explains how to parse data using unstructured.io. Unstructured.io provides a powerful multimodal ingestor to ingest data for further use in RAG with R2R.

## Setup

You just need to specify `unstructured` or `unstructured-api` in the [parsing] section of the config file. We have provided a config called `unstructured.toml` that you can use.

If you are using Docker, then you can use the following command to start the R2R server:

```bash
r2r serve --docker --config-name=unstructured --image=ragtoriches/prod-unstructured:latest
```
If you are using the local setup, then you need to install additional dependencies. To install them, you can run the following command:

```bash
poetry add "unstructured[all-docs]"
poetry add unstructured_client
```

And then you can start the R2R server by running the following command:

```bash
r2r serve --config-name=unstructured
```

## Configuration

If you are using the `unstructured-api` parser, then you need to set the following environment variables:

- `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL`: The URL of the Unstructured API.
- `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`: The API key of the Unstructured API. (optional)

You can configure the parser and chunking options in the [parsing] and [chunking] sections of the config file. An example is shown below:

```toml
[parsing]
    provider = "unstructured-api"

[chunking]
    strategy = "by_title"
```

For more configuration options, you can refer to the [Unstructured.io documentation](https://unstructured.io/docs/quickstart/installation/).
