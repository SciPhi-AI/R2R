## Chunking Provider

Chunking is the process of breaking down parsed documents into smaller, manageable pieces. Configure the chunking provider as follows:


```toml r2r.toml
[chunking]
provider = "unstructured_local"
strategy = "auto"
chunking_strategy = "by_title"
new_after_n_chars = 512
max_characters = 1_024
combine_under_n_chars = 128
overlap = 20
```

### Supported Chunkers
- `unstructured_local`: Default chunking provider, uses the open source Unstructured library
- `unstructured_api`: Uses the Unstructured platform API
- `r2r`:  Lightweight chunking provided by R2R

Chunking methods:
- `by_title`, supported by unstructured
- `basic`, supported by unstructured
- `recursive`, supported by r2r

Chunking providers can be specified at runtime with the [`ingest_files`](/api-reference/endpoint/ingest_files) endpoint.
