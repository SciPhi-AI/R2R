## Chunking Provider

Chunking is the process of breaking down parsed documents into smaller, manageable pieces. Configure the chunking provider as follows:


```toml r2r.toml
[chunking]
provider = "r2r"
method = "recursive"
chunk_size = 512
chunk_overlap = 50
```

### Supported Chunkers
- `r2r`: Default chunking method provided by R2R
- `unstructured`: Chunking methods from the Unstructured library (requires additional installation)

Chunking methods:
- `by_title`, supported by unstructured
- `basic`, supported by unstructured
- `recursive`, supported by R2R

Chunking providers can be specified at runtime with the [`ingest_files`](/api-reference/endpoint/ingest_files) endpoint.
