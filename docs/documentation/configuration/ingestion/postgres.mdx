## Postgres Databases

R2R uses Postgres as its default database provider for relational and vector search queries. To customize the database settings, you can modify the `database` section in your `r2r.toml` file and set corresponding environment variables or provide the settings directly in the configuration file.

## Postgres Configuration

1. Edit the `database` section in your `r2r.toml` file:

```toml r2r.toml
[database]
provider = "postgres"
  [database.extra_fields]
  user = "your_postgres_user"
  password = "your_postgres_password"
  host = "your_postgres_host"
  port = "your_postgres_port"
  db_name = "your_database_name"
  vecs_collection = "your_vector_collection_name"
```

2. Alternatively, you can set the following environment variables:

```bash
export POSTGRES_USER=your_postgres_user
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
export POSTGRES_HOST=your_postgres_host
export POSTGRES_PORT=your_postgres_port
export POSTGRES_DBNAME=your_database_name
export POSTGRES_VECS_COLLECTION=your_vector_collection_name
```



Let's break down the Postgres configuration options:

- `user`: The username for connecting to your Postgres database.
- `password`: The password for the specified user.
- `host`: The hostname or IP address of your Postgres server.
- `port`: The port number on which Postgres is running (default is usually 5432).
- `db_name`: The name of the database you want to use for R2R.
- `vecs_collection`: The name of the collection to use for storing vector embeddings.

### Important Notes:

1. If you provide both environment variables and `extra_fields` in the `r2r.toml` file, the `extra_fields` values will take precedence.

2. Ensure that all required fields are set either through environment variables or in the `r2r.toml` file. If any required field is missing, R2R will raise a `ValueError` with a descriptive error message.

3. The database connection string is constructed as follows:
   ```
   postgresql://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{db_name}
   ```

4. Make sure your Postgres database is properly set up and accessible with the provided credentials before starting R2R.

5. If you're using a cloud-hosted Postgres service, make sure to configure any necessary firewall rules or security groups to allow connections from your R2R application.

By customizing these settings, you can configure R2R to use your specific Postgres database instance, allowing for flexibility in your deployment setup and data management.
