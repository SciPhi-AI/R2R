## Parsing & Chunking

R2R supports different parsing and chunking providers to extract text from various document formats and break it down into manageable pieces for efficient processing and retrieval.

To configure the parsing and chunking settings, update the `[ingestion]` section in your `r2r.toml` file:

```toml
[ingestion]
provider = "r2r" # or "unstructured_local" or "unstructured_api"
# ... provider-specific settings ...
```

### Supported Providers

R2R offers two main parsing and chunking providers:

1. **R2R (default for 'light' installation)**:
   - Uses R2R's built-in parsing and chunking logic.
   - Supports a wide range of file types, including TXT, JSON, HTML, PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, CSV, Markdown, images, audio, and video.
   - Configuration options:
     ```toml
     [ingestion]
     provider = "r2r"
     chunking_strategy = "recursive"
     chunk_size = 1_024
     chunk_overlap = 512
     excluded_parsers = ["mp4"]
     ```
   - `chunking_strategy`: The chunking method ("recursive").
   - `chunk_size`: The target size for each chunk.
   - `chunk_overlap`: The number of characters to overlap between chunks.
   - `excluded_parsers`: List of parsers to exclude (e.g., ["mp4"]).

2. **Unstructured (default for 'full' installation)**:
   - Leverages Unstructured's open-source ingestion platform.
   - Provides more advanced parsing capabilities.
   - Configuration options:
     ```toml
     [ingestion]
     provider = "unstructured_local"
     strategy = "auto"
     chunking_strategy = "by_title"
     new_after_n_chars = 512
     max_characters = 1_024
     combine_under_n_chars = 128
     overlap = 20
     ```
   - `strategy`: The overall chunking strategy ("auto", "fast", or "hi_res").
   - `chunking_strategy`: The specific chunking method ("by_title" or "basic").
   - `new_after_n_chars`: Soft maximum size for a chunk.
   - `max_characters`: Hard maximum size for a chunk.
   - `combine_under_n_chars`: Minimum size for combining small sections.
   - `overlap`: Number of characters to overlap between chunks.

### Supported File Types

Both R2R and Unstructured providers support parsing a wide range of file types, including:

- TXT, JSON, HTML, PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, CSV, Markdown, images (BMP, GIF, HEIC, JPEG, JPG, PNG, SVG, TIFF), audio (MP3), video (MP4), and more.

Refer to the [Unstructured documentation](https://docs.unstructured.io/welcome) for more details on their ingestion capabilities and limitations.

### Configuring Parsing & Chunking

To configure parsing and chunking settings, update the `[ingestion]` section in your `r2r.toml` file with the desired provider and its specific settings.

For example, to use the R2R provider with custom chunk size and overlap:

```toml
[ingestion]
provider = "r2r"
chunking_strategy = "recursive"
chunk_size = 2_048
chunk_overlap = 256
excluded_parsers = ["mp4"]
```

Or, to use the Unstructured provider with a specific chunking strategy and character limits:

```toml
[ingestion]
provider = "unstructured_local"
strategy = "hi_res"
chunking_strategy = "basic"
new_after_n_chars = 1_000
max_characters = 2_000
combine_under_n_chars = 256
overlap = 50
```

Adjust the settings based on your specific requirements and the characteristics of your input documents.
