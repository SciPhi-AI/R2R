## Parsing

R2R supports different parsing providers to extract text from various document formats. To configure the parsing provider:

```toml example r2r.toml
[parsing]
provider = "unstructured_local" # | rag | unstructured_api
excluded_parsers = ["mp4"]
```
Available providers:
- `r2r`: Liteweight parser provided by R2R
- `unstructured_local`: Default offering, makes use of open source Unstructured package.
- `unstructured_api`: Cloud offering of Unstructured

### Supported File Types

**R2R supports parsing for the following file types:**

- BMP (Bitmap Image)
- CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- DOC (Microsoft Word Document)
- DOCX (Microsoft Word Document)
- EML (Electronic Mail)
- EPUB (Electronic Publication)
- GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)
- HEIC (High-Efficiency Image Format)
- HTM (HyperText Markup)
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
- JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- MD (Markdown)
- MSG (Microsoft Outlook Message)

- MP4 (MPEG-4 Part 14)
- ODT (Open Document Text)
- ORG (Org Mode)
- PDF (Portable Document Format)
- P7S (PKCS#7)
- PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
- PPT (PowerPoint)
- PPTX (Microsoft PowerPoint Presentation)
- RST (reStructured Text)
- RTF (Rich Text Format)
- SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- TSV (Tab-Separated Values)
- TXT (Plain Text)
- XLS (Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet)
- XLSX (Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet)
- XML (Extensible Markup Language)
- TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)
- MP4 (MPEG-4 Part 14)

<Note> Parsing providers for an R2R system cannot be configured at runtime and are instead configured server side. </Note>

**Refer to the [Unstructured documentation](https://docs.unstructured.io/welcome) for details about their ingestion capabilities and limitations.**

## Chunking

R2R uses chunking to break down parsed documents into smaller, manageable pieces for efficient processing and retrieval. Configure the chunking settings in `r2r.toml`:

```toml r2r.toml
[chunking]
provider = "unstructured_local"
strategy = "auto"
chunking_strategy = "by_title"
new_after_n_chars = 512
max_characters = 1_024
combine_under_n_chars = 128
overlap = 20
```

Key chunking configuration options:

- `provider`: The chunking provider (defaults to "unstructured_local").
- `strategy`: The overall chunking strategy ("auto", "fast", or "hi_res").
- `chunking_strategy`: The specific chunking method ("by_title" or "basic").
- `new_after_n_chars`: Soft maximum size for a chunk.
- `max_characters`: Hard maximum size for a chunk.
- `combine_under_n_chars`: Minimum size for combining small sections.
- `overlap`: Number of characters to overlap between chunks.

## Supported Providers

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Unstructured Local">
    ```python
    # No additional setup required
    # Ensure unstructured is installed: pip install unstructured


    # Set 'provider = "unstructured_local"' for `[parsing]` and `[chunking]` in `my_r2r.toml`
    r2r serve --config-path=my_r2r.toml
    ```
    Supported chunking strategies:
    - by_title
    - basic

    This is the default provider, using the open-source Unstructured library for local processing.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Unstructured API">
    ```python
    export UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY=your_unstructured_api_key
    export UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL=your_unstructured_api_url
    # .. set other environment variables

    # Optional - Update default provider
    # Set 'provider = "unstructured_api"' for `[parsing]` and `[chunking]` in `my_r2r.toml`
    r2r serve --config-path=my_r2r.toml
    ```
    Supported chunking strategies:
    - by_title
    - basic

    Uses the Unstructured platform API for chunking, which may offer additional features or performance benefits.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="R2R">
    ```python
    # No additional setup required

    # Optional - Update default provider
    # Set 'provider = "r2r"' for `[parsing]` and `[chunking]` in `my_r2r.toml`
    r2r serve --config-path=my_r2r.toml
    ```
    Supported chunking strategies:
    - recursive

    A lightweight chunking method provided by R2R, suitable for basic chunking needs.
  </Tab>

### Advanced Configuration Options

When using the Unstructured chunking provider, you can specify additional parameters in the configuration file:

```toml
[chunking]
provider = "unstructured_local"  # or "unstructured_api"
strategy = "auto"  # "auto", "fast", or "hi_res"
chunking_strategy = "by_title"  # "by_title" or "basic"

# Core chunking parameters
combine_under_n_chars = 128
max_characters = 500
new_after_n_chars = 1500
overlap = 0

# Additional chunking options
coordinates = false
encoding = "utf-8"
extract_image_block_types = []  # List of image block types to extract
gz_uncompressed_content_type = null
hi_res_model_name = null
include_orig_elements = true
include_page_breaks = false

languages = []  # List of languages to consider
multipage_sections = true
ocr_languages = []  # List of languages for OCR
output_format = "application/json"
overlap_all = false
pdf_infer_table_structure = true

similarity_threshold = null
skip_infer_table_types = []  # List of table types to skip inference
split_pdf_concurrency_level = 5
split_pdf_page = true
starting_page_number = null
unique_element_ids = false
xml_keep_tags = false
```

These options allow fine-tuning of the chunking process for specific document types or requirements. Refer to the Unstructured [documentation here](https://docs.unstructured.io/open-source/core-functionality/chunking) for more details on the available settings.

### Runtime Configuration

The chunking configuration can be specified at runtime with the [`ingest_files`](/api-reference/endpoint/ingest_files) endpoint, allowing dynamic adjustment of chunking parameters based on the input documents or specific use cases.

### Combining Chunking with Other R2R Components

Chunking is a crucial part of the document processing pipeline in R2R. It works in conjunction with other components such as parsing, embedding, and retrieval. For example:

```python
response = client.ingest_files(
    file_paths=["document.pdf"],
    chunking_config={
        "provider": "unstructured_local",
        "chunking_strategy": "by_title",
        "max_characters": 1000
    },
    embedding_config={...},
    # ... other configurations
)
```

For more detailed information on configuring chunking and other ingestion settings, please refer to the [Ingestion Configuration documentation](/documentation/configuration/ingestion/overview).
