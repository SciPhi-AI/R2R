## Analytics and Observability
R2R provides various tools for analytics and observability to help you monitor and improve the performance of your RAG system.

### Completion Scores
Scores act as an observability metric and are attached to RAG completions in R2R.

Scores are bound to values between -1 (a strong negative association) and 1 (a strong positive association), where:
- A score close to 1 may indicate a highly relevant and accurate completion
- A score close to 0 may indicate a neutral or uncertain quality
- A score close to -1 may indicate a potentially irrelevant or incorrect completion

```python
response = client.score_completion("message_id_here", 0.75)
```


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Response">
    <ResponseField name="response" type="dict">
      The response from the R2R system.
      ```python
      { 'results': 'ok' }
      ```
    </ResponseField>
  </Accordion>
