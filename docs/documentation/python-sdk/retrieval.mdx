## AI Powered Search

### Search

Perform a basic vector search:

```python
search_response = client.search("What was Uber's profit in 2020?")
```


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Response">
    <ResponseField name="response" type="dict">
      The search results from the R2R system.
      ```python
      {

### Search custom settings

Learn more about the search [API here](/api-reference/endpoint/search). It allows searching with custom settings, such as bespoke document filters and larger search limits:
```python
# returns only chunks from documents with title `document_title`
filtered_search_response = client.search(
    "What was Uber's profit in 2020?",
    vector_search_settings={
        # restrict results to the Uber document
        "search_filters": {"title": {"$eq": "uber_2021.pdf"}},
        "search_limit": 100
    }
)
```


### Hybrid Search


Learn more about the dedicated knowledge graph capabilities [in R2R here](/cookbooks/hybrid-search). Combine traditional keyword-based search with vector search:

```python
hybrid_search_response = client.search(
    "What was Uber's profit in 2020?",
    vector_search_settings={
        "use_hybrid_search": True,
        "search_limit": 20,
        "hybrid_search_settings": {
            "full_text_weight": 1.0,
            "semantic_weight": 10.0,
            "full_text_limit": 200,
            "rrf_k": 25,
        },
    }
)
```

### Knowledge Graph Search

Learn more about the dedicated knowledge graph capabilities [in R2R here](/cookbooks/graphrag). You can utilize knowledge graph capabilities to enhance search results, as shown below:

```python
kg_search_response = client.search(
    "What is airbnb",
    vector_search_settings={"use_vector_search": False}
    kg_search_settings={
      "use_kg_search": True,

### RAG with custom search settings

Learn more about the RAG [API here](/api-reference/endpoint/rag). It allows performing RAG with custom settings, such as hybrid search:

```python
hybrid_rag_response = client.rag(
    "Who is John Snow?",
    vector_search_settings={"use_hybrid_search": True}
)
```

### RAG with custom completion LLM

R2R supports configuration on server-side and at runtime, which you can [read about here](/documentation/configuration/rag). An example below, using Anthropic at runtime:

```python
anthropic_rag_response = client.rag(
    "What is R2R?",
    rag_generation_config={"model":"anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229"}
)
```


### Streaming RAG

R2R supports streaming RAG responses for real-time applications:

```python
stream_response = client.rag(
    "Who was Aristotle?",
    rag_generation_config={"stream": True}
)
for chunk in stream_response:
    print(chunk, end='', flush=True)
```
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Response">
    <ResponseField name="response" type="Generator">
    ```bash
    <search>["{\"id\":\"808c47c5-ebef-504a-a230-aa9ddcfbd87 .... </search>
    <completion>Lyft reported a net loss of $1,752,857,000 in 2020 according to [2]. Therefore, Lyft did not make a profit in 2020.</completion>
    ```
    </ResponseField>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Customizing RAG

Putting everything together for highly customized RAG functionality at runtime:

```python

custom_rag_response = client.rag(
    "Who was Aristotle?",
    vector_search_settings={
        "use_hybrid_search": True,
        "search_limit": 20,
        "hybrid_search_settings": {
            "full_text_weight": 1.0,
            "semantic_weight": 10.0,
            "full_text_limit": 200,
            "rrf_k": 25,
        },
    },
    kg_search_settings={
        "use_kg_search": True,
        "kg_search_type": "local",
    },
    rag_generation_config={
        "model": "anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307",
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "stream": True
    },
    task_prompt_override="Only answer the question if the context is SUPER relevant!!\n\nQuery:\n{query}\n\nContext:\n{context}"
)
```

## Agents

### Multi-turn agentic RAG
The R2R application includes agents which come equipped with a search tool, enabling them to perform RAG. Using the R2R Agent for multi-turn conversations:

```python
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What was Aristotle's main contribution to philosophy?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Aristotle made numerous significant contributions to philosophy, but one of his main contributions was in the field of logic and reasoning. He developed a system of formal logic, which is considered the first comprehensive system of its kind in Western philosophy. This system, often referred to as Aristotelian logic or term logic, provided a framework for deductive reasoning and laid the groundwork for scientific thinking."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Can you elaborate on how this influenced later thinkers?"}
]

rag_agent_response = client.agent(
    messages,
    vector_search_settings={"use_hybrid_search":True},
)
```

Note that any of the customization seen in AI powered search and RAG documentation above can be applied here.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Response">
    <ResponseField name="response" type="Object">
    The agent endpoint will return the entire conversation as a response, including internal tool calls.

The revival of Aristotelianism during the Renaissance helped bridge the gap between ancient Greek philosophy and modern scientific thought [2][6].

        4. **Development of Modern Science**: Aristotle's method of systematic observation and classification in natural sciences laid the groundwork for the scientific method. His influence extended well into the 19th century, impacting the development of various scientific disciplines [9].

        Overall, Aristotle's contributions to logic, ethics, natural sciences, and metaphysics created a foundation upon which much of Western intellectual tradition was built.
