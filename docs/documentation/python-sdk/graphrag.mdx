      The parameters for the Leiden algorithm.
      <Expandable title="LeidenParams">
        <ParamField path="max_cluster_size" type="int">
          Default is ``1000``. Any partition or cluster with
          membership >= ``max_cluster_size`` will be isolated into a subnetwork. This
          subnetwork will be used for a new leiden global partition mapping, which will
          then be remapped back into the global space after completion. Once all
          clusters with membership >= ``max_cluster_size`` have been completed, the level
          increases and the partition scheme is scanned again for any new clusters with
          membership >= ``max_cluster_size`` and the process continues until every
          cluster's membership is < ``max_cluster_size`` or if they cannot be broken into
          more than one new community.

        </ParamField>
        <ParamField path="starting_communities" type="Optional[Dict[Any, int]]">
          Default is ``None``. An optional community mapping dictionary that contains a node
          id mapping to the community it belongs to. Please see the Notes section regarding
          node ids used.

          If no community map is provided, the default behavior is to create a node
          community identity map, where every node is in their own community.
        </ParamField>
        <ParamField path="extra_forced_iterations" type="int">
          Default is ``0``. Leiden will run until a maximum quality score has been found
          for the node clustering and no nodes are moved to a new cluster in another
          iteration. As there is an element of randomness to the Leiden algorithm, it is
          sometimes useful to set ``extra_forced_iterations`` to a number larger than 0
          where the entire process is forced to attempt further refinement.
        </ParamField>
        <ParamField path="resolution" type="Union[int, float]">
                Default is ``1.0``. Higher resolution values lead to more communities and lower
        resolution values leads to fewer communities. Must be greater than 0.

        </ParamField>
        <ParamField path="randomness" type="Union[int, float]">
        Default is ``0.001``. The larger the randomness value, the more exploration of
        the partition space is possible. This is a major difference from the Louvain
        algorithm, which is purely greedy in the partition exploration.
        </ParamField>
        <ParamField path="use_modularity" type="bool">
        Default is ``True``. If ``False``, will use a Constant Potts Model (CPM).
        </ParamField>
        <ParamField path="random_seed" type="Optional[int]">
        Default is ``7272``. Can provide an optional seed to the PRNG used in Leiden
        for deterministic output.
        </ParamField>
        <ParamField path="weight_attribute" type="str">
        Default is ``weight``. Only used when creating a weighed edge list of tuples
        when the source graph is a networkx graph. This attribute corresponds to the
        edge data dict key.
        </ParamField>
        <ParamField path="is_weighted" type="Optional[bool]">
        Default is ``None``. Only used when creating a weighted edge list of tuples
        when the source graph is an adjacency matrix. The
        :func:`graspologic.utils.is_unweighted` function will scan these
        matrices and attempt to determine whether it is weighted or not. This flag can
        short circuit this test and the values in the adjacency matrix will be treated
        as weights.
        </ParamField>
        <ParamField path="weight_default" type="Union[int, float]">
        Default is ``1.0``. If the graph is a networkx graph and the graph does not
        have a fully weighted sequence of edges, this default will be used. If the
        adjacency matrix is found or specified to be unweighted, this weight_default
        will be used for every edge.
        </ParamField>
        <ParamField path="check_directed" type="bool">
        Default is ``True``. If the graph is an adjacency matrix, we will attempt to
        ascertain whether it is directed or undirected. As our leiden implementation is
        only known to work with an undirected graph, this function will raise an error
        if it is found to be a directed graph. If you know it is undirected and wish to
        avoid this scan, you can set this value to ``False`` and only the lower triangle
        of the adjacency matrix will be used to generate the weighted edge list.
