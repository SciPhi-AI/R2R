## Key Terms

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: A technique that combines information retrieval and language model generation to produce more accurate and informative responses.
- **Ingestion**: The process of parsing and indexing documents into the R2R system for later retrieval and generation.
- **Fragment**: A chunk of text extracted from an ingested document, used for similarity search and context in RAG.
- **Hybrid Search**: A search method that combines semantic vector search with traditional keyword search for improved relevancy.
- **Knowledge Graph**: A structured representation of entities and their relationships, used for advanced querying and reasoning.
- **RAG Agent**: An interactive and intelligent query interface that can formulate its own questions, search for information, and provide informed responses based on retrieved context.
- **Collection**: A grouping of documents and users for efficient access control and organization.
