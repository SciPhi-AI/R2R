## Introduction

To run R2R with default local LLM settings, execute `r2r serve --docker --config-name=local_llm`.

R2R supports RAG with local LLMs through the Ollama library. You may follow the instructions on their [official website](https://ollama.com/) to install Ollama outside of the R2R Docker.

## Preparing Local LLMs

Next, make sure that you have all the necessary LLMs installed:
```bash
# in a separate terminal
ollama pull llama3.1
ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
ollama serve
```

These commands will need to be replaced with models specific to your configuration when deploying R2R with a customized configuration.

## Configuration

R2R uses a TOML configuration file for managing settings, which you can [read about here](/documentation/configuration/introduction). For local setup, we'll use the default `local_llm` configuration. This can be customized to your needs by setting up a standalone project.

<Accordion icon="gear" title="Local Configuration Details">
The `local_llm` configuration file (`core/configs/local_llm.toml`) includes:

```toml
[completion]
provider = "litellm"
concurrent_request_limit = 1

  [completion.generation_config]
  model = "ollama/llama3.1"
  temperature = 0.1
  top_p = 1
  max_tokens_to_sample = 1_024
  stream = false
  add_generation_kwargs = { }

[database]
provider = "postgres"

[embedding]
provider = "ollama"
base_model = "mxbai-embed-large"
base_dimension = 1_024
batch_size = 32
add_title_as_prefix = true
concurrent_request_limit = 32

[ingestion]
excluded_parsers = [ "mp4" ]
```

This configuration uses `ollama` and the model `mxbai-embed-large` to run embeddings. We have excluded media file parsers as they are not yet supported locally.

<Note>
We are still working on adding local multimodal RAG features. Your feedback would be appreciated.

## Summary

The above steps are all you need to get RAG up and running with local LLMs in R2R. For detailed setup and basic functionality, refer back to the [R2R Quickstart]((/documentation/quickstart/introduction).
