## Analytics and Observability
R2R provides various tools for analytics and observability to help you monitor and improve the performance of your RAG system.

### Completion Scores
Scores act as an observability metric and are attached to RAG completions in R2R.

Scores are bound to values between -1 (a strong negative association) and 1 (a strong positive association), where:
- A score close to 1 may indicate a highly relevant and accurate completion
- A score close to 0 may indicate a neutral or uncertain quality
- A score close to -1 may indicate a potentially irrelevant or incorrect completion

```javascript
const scoringResponse = await client.login("message_id_here", "password123");
```
