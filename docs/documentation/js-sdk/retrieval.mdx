### Search

Perform a basic vector search:

```javascript
const searchResponse = await client.search("What was Uber's profit in 2020?");
```

    search_limit: 100
    },
)
```


### Hybrid Search

Combine traditional keyword-based search with vector search:

```javascript
const hybrid_search_response = client.search(
    "What was Uber's profit in 2020?",
    { search_filters: {
        $eq: "uber_2021.pdf"

### RAG with custom search settings

Use hybrid search in RAG:

```javascript
const hybridRagResponse = await client.rag({
  query: "Who is John Snow?",
  use_hybrid_search: true
});
```

### RAG with custom completion LLM

Use a different LLM model for RAG:

```javascript
const customLLMRagResponse = await client.rag({
  query: "What is R2R?",
  rag_generation_config: {
    model: "anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229"
  }
});
```

### Streaming RAG

Stream RAG responses for real-time applications:

```javascript
const streamResponse = await client.rag({
  query: "Who was Aristotle?",
  rag_generation_config: { stream: true }
});

if (streamResponse instanceof ReadableStream) {
  const reader = streamResponse.getReader();
  while (true) {
    const { done, value } = await reader.read();
    if (done) break;
    console.log(new TextDecoder().decode(value));
  }
}
```

### Customizing RAG

Putting everything together for highly custom RAG functionality:

```javascript
const customRagResponse = await client.rag({
  query: "Who was Aristotle?",
  use_vector_search: true,
  use_hybrid_search: true,
  use_kg_search: true,
  kg_generation_config: {},
  rag_generation_config: {
    model: "anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307",
    temperature: 0.7,
    stream: true
  }
});
```

## Agents

### Multi-turn agentic RAG
The R2R application includes agents which come equipped with a search tool, enabling them to perform RAG. Using the R2R Agent for multi-turn conversations:

```javascript
const messages = [
  { role: "user", content: "What was Aristotle's main contribution to philosophy?" },
  { role: "assistant", content: "Aristotle made numerous significant contributions to philosophy, but one of his main contributions was in the field of logic and reasoning. He developed a system of formal logic, which is considered the first comprehensive system of its kind in Western philosophy. This system, often referred to as Aristotelian logic or term logic, provided a framework for deductive reasoning and laid the groundwork for scientific thinking." },
  { role: "user", content: "Can you elaborate on how this influenced later thinkers?" }
];

const agentResponse = await client.agent({
  messages,
  use_vector_search: true,
  use_hybrid_search: true
});
```

Note that any of the customization seen in AI powered search and RAG documentation above can be applied here.

Aristotle\'s views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. The influence of his physical science extended from late antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and was not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed. He influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophies during the Middle Ages, as well as Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition\n3. the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as "The First Teacher", and among medieval Christians like Thomas Aquinas as simply "The Philosopher", while the poet Dante called him "the master of those who know". His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, and were studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abelard and Jean Buridan. Aristotle\'s influence on logic continued well into the 19th century. In addition, his ethics, although\n4. hilosophy\nFurther information: Peripatetic school The immediate influence of Aristotle\'s work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the Peripatetic school. Aristotle\'s students included Aristoxenus, Dicaearchus, Demetrius of Phalerum, Eudemos of Rhodes, Harpalus, Hephaestion, Mnason of Phocis, Nicomachus, and Theophrastus. Aristotle\'s influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter\'s bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers.

Alkindus greatly admired Aristotle\'s philosophy,[168] and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the "exemplar" for all future philosophers.[169] Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the "First Teacher".[167] The title was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of Dante) who were influenced by the tradition of Islamic philosophy.[170]\n\nMedieval Europe\nFurther information: Aristotelianism and Syllogism § Medieval\n6. those by James of Venice and William of Moerbeke. After the Scholastic Thomas Aquinas wrote his Summa Theologica, working from Moerbeke\'s translations and calling Aristotle "The Philosopher",[172] the demand for Aristotle\'s writings grew, and the Greek manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the Renaissance.[173] These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages.',

Here are some key ways in which his work influenced subsequent intellectual traditions:\n\n1. Medieval Islamic Philosophy: Aristotle was highly revered among medieval Muslim scholars, who referred to him as \"The First Teacher.\" His works were extensively studied and commented upon by philosophers such as Averroes and Avicenna. These scholars played a crucial role in preserving and expanding upon Aristotle's ideas, which later influenced Western thought [5].\n\n2. Christian Scholasticism: In medieval Europe, Aristotle's works were integrated into Christian theology, particularly through the efforts of Thomas Aquinas, who referred to Aristotle as \"The Philosopher.\" Aquinas' synthesis of Aristotelian philosophy with Christian doctrine became a cornerstone of Scholasticism, a dominant intellectual tradition in medieval Europe [3][6].\n\n3. Renaissance and Enlightenment: Aristotle's influence persisted into the Renaissance, where his works were revived and studied extensively. This period saw a renewed interest in classical texts, and Aristotle's ideas continued to shape scientific and philosophical inquiry until the Enlightenment, when new scientific paradigms began to emerge [2][6].\n\n4. Development of Logic: Aristotle's system of formal logic remained the standard for centuries and was studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abelard and Jean Buridan. His influence on logic extended well into the 19th century, shaping the development of this field [3].\n\n5. Peripatetic School: Aristotle's immediate influence was also felt through the Peripatetic school, which he founded. His students, including Theophrastus, carried on his work and further developed his ideas, ensuring that his intellectual legacy continued [4].\n\nOverall, Aristotle's contributions laid the groundwork for many fields of study and influenced a wide range of thinkers, making him one of the most significant figures in the history of Western philosophy and beyond.",

### Multi-turn agentic RAG with streaming

The response from the RAG agent may be streamed directly back:

```javascript
const messages = [
  { role: "user", content: "What was Aristotle's main contribution to philosophy?" },
  { role: "assistant", content: "Aristotle made numerous significant contributions to philosophy, but one of his main contributions was in the field of logic and reasoning. He developed a system of formal logic, which is considered the first comprehensive system of its kind in Western philosophy. This system, often referred to as Aristotelian logic or term logic, provided a framework for deductive reasoning and laid the groundwork for scientific thinking." },

Here are some key ways in which his work influenced subsequent intellectual traditions:

1. Medieval Islamic Philosophy: Aristotle was highly revered among medieval Muslim scholars, who referred to him as "The First Teacher." His works were extensively translated into Arabic and studied by philosophers such as Averroes and Avicenna. These scholars not only preserved Aristotle's works but also expanded upon them, influencing both Islamic and Western thought.

2. Christian Scholasticism: In medieval Europe, Aristotle's works were integrated into Christian theology, particularly through the efforts of Thomas Aquinas, who referred to Aristotle as "The Philosopher." Aquinas's synthesis of Aristotelian philosophy with Christian doctrine became a cornerstone of Scholasticism, a dominant intellectual tradition in medieval Europe.

3. Renaissance and Enlightenment: Aristotle's influence persisted into the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods. His works on logic, ethics, and natural sciences were foundational texts for scholars during these eras. The revival of Aristotelianism during the Renaissance helped bridge the gap between ancient Greek philosophy and modern scientific thought.

4. Development of Logic: Aristotle's system of formal logic remained the standard for centuries and was studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abelard and Jean Buridan. His influence on logic extended well into the 19th century, shaping the development of this field.

5. Peripatetic School: Aristotle's immediate influence was felt through the Peripatetic school, which he founded. His students, including Theophrastus, continued to develop and disseminate his ideas, ensuring that his philosophical legacy endured.

Overall, Aristotle's contributions to logic, ethics, natural sciences, and metaphysics created a foundation upon which much of Western intellectual tradition was built. His work influenced a wide range of fields and thinkers, making him one of the most pivotal figures in the history of philosophy.</completion>
