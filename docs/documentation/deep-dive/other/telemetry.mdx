R2R uses telemetry to collect **anonymous** usage information. This data helps us understand how R2R is used, prioritize new features and bug fixes, and improve overall performance and stability.

## Disabling Telemetry

To opt out of telemetry, you can set an environment variable:

```bash
export TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

<Note>
Valid values to disable telemetry are `false`, `0`, or `f`. When telemetry is disabled, no events will be captured.
</Note>

## Collected Information

Our telemetry system collects basic, anonymous information such as:

- **Feature Usage**: Which features are being used and their frequency of use.
