## Introduction

R2R employs a sophisticated pipeline architecture to process data efficiently and flexibly. This modular approach allows for easy customization, extension, and maintenance of complex data processing workflows. Pipelines in R2R are composed of a series of `AsyncPipe` instances, each responsible for a specific task in the data processing sequence.

## Key Concepts

### AsyncPipe

`AsyncPipe` is the fundamental building block of R2R pipelines. It defines a standard interface for asynchronous data processing with advanced features:

#### Key Features of AsyncPipe

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Leverages Python's `async/await` syntax for efficient I/O operations.
- **Typed Inputs**: Defines input structure using Pydantic models, ensuring type safety.
- **State Management**: Interacts with a shared `AsyncState` object for complex, stateful operations.
- **Configurability**: Uses a `PipeConfig` for customization, enabling adaptability to various use cases.
- **Integrated Logging**: Includes a built-in logging system with a log worker for efficient log management.

```python
class AsyncPipe:
    class PipeConfig(BaseModel):
        name: str = "default_pipe"
        max_log_queue_size: int = 100

    class Input(BaseModel):
        message: AsyncGenerator[Any, None]

    async def run(self, input: Input, state: AsyncState, run_manager: Optional[RunManager] = None, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> AsyncGenerator[Any, None]:
        # Run logic with logging capabilities...

    @abstractmethod
    async def _run_logic(self, input: Input, state: AsyncState, run_id: uuid.UUID, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> AsyncGenerator[Any, None]:
        pass
```

### AsyncState

`AsyncState` is a thread-safe state object used for storing and managing data between pipes:

```python
class AsyncState:
    async def update(self, outer_key: str, values: dict):
        # Update the state with new values...

    async def get(self, outer_key: str, inner_key: str, default=None):
        # Get a value from the state...

    async def delete(self, outer_key: str, inner_key: Optional[str] = None):
        # Delete a value from the state...
```

### AsyncPipeline

`AsyncPipeline` manages the execution of a sequence of `AsyncPipe` instances:

#### Key Aspects of AsyncPipeline

- **Flexible Composition**: Can be composed of any number and type of pipes.
- **Data Flow Management**: Ensures output from one pipe becomes input for the next.
- **Parallel Processing Support**: Allows for concurrent execution of pipes where applicable.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Manages errors and exceptions across the entire process.
- **Stream Processing**: Supports both streaming and non-streaming modes of operation.

```python
class AsyncPipeline:
    def add_pipe(self, pipe: AsyncPipe, add_upstream_outputs: Optional[list[dict[str, str]]] = None, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        # Add a pipe to the pipeline...

    async def run(self, input: Any, state: Optional[AsyncState] = None, stream: bool = False, run_manager: Optional[RunManager] = None, log_run_info: bool = True, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any):
        # Run the pipeline...
```

## Pipeline Types in R2R

R2R implements several specialized pipeline types, defined in the `PipelineTypes` enum:

- **EVAL**: For evaluation tasks.
- **INGESTION**: For processing and storing input documents.
- **SEARCH**: For retrieving relevant information from stored data.
- **RAG**: For Retrieval-Augmented Generation tasks.
- **OTHER**: For custom or miscellaneous pipeline types.

Each specialized pipeline, like `EvalPipeline`, extends the base `AsyncPipeline` class with type-specific functionality.

## Advanced Features

- **Upstream Outputs**: Pipes can access outputs from previous pipes, allowing for complex data flow patterns.
- **Run Management**: The `RunManager` class provides utilities for managing and logging pipeline runs.
- **Asynchronous Generator Handling**: The pipeline can work with nested asynchronous generators, consuming them as needed.

## Conclusion

R2R's pipeline architecture provides a powerful and flexible foundation for building sophisticated data processing applications. The combination of `AsyncPipe`, `AsyncState`, and `AsyncPipeline` classes, along with specialized pipeline types and advanced features like upstream output handling, enables developers to create efficient, scalable, and maintainable solutions for complex information retrieval and generation tasks.
