# R2R Search Pipeline

## Introduction

The R2R Search Pipeline is a sophisticated component designed for retrieving relevant information using both vector embeddings and knowledge graphs. It provides a versatile system that supports hybrid search capabilities, allowing for efficient and accurate information retrieval across different data structures.

<Note>
Before diving deep into the Search Pipeline, we recommend starting with the [R2R Quickstart](/documentation/quickstart) guide to familiarize yourself with R2R's basic concepts and operations.
</Note>

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Search**: Combines vector-based semantic search with knowledge graph querying for comprehensive results.
- **Vector-based Search**: Utilizes embeddings to perform semantic searches on vector databases.
- **Knowledge Graph Querying**: Leverages graph structures for complex, relationship-based queries.
- **Customizable**: Supports custom configurations for search filters, limits, and query generation.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Efficiently handles search operations with asynchronous processing.
- **Reranking**: Implements result reranking for improved relevance (in vector search).

## Pipeline Architecture

The Search Pipeline in R2R consists of two main components that can be used independently or in combination:

1. Vector Search Pipeline
2. Knowledge Graph Search Pipeline

Here's a high-level overview of the pipeline structure:

    E --> G[Search Results]
    F --> G
```

## Pipeline Components

### Vector Search Pipeline

The Vector Search Pipeline processes queries and returns relevant results by leveraging vector embeddings.

#### Key Features

- Semantic search using vector embeddings
- Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching
- Customizable search filters and limits
- Asynchronous processing for efficiency
- Result reranking for improved relevance

#### Vector Search Pipe

The core component of the Vector Search Pipeline is the `VectorSearchPipe`:

```python
class VectorSearchPipe(SearchPipe):
    async def search(
        self,
        message: str,
        run_id: uuid.UUID,
        vector_search_settings: VectorSearchSettings,
        *args: Any,
        **kwargs: Any,
    ) -> AsyncGenerator[VectorSearchResult, None]:
        # Vector search implementation
```

<Note>
For a quick introduction to hybrid search in R2R, check out the [Hybrid Search Cookbook](/cookbooks/hybrid-search).
</Note>

### Knowledge Graph Search Pipeline

The Knowledge Graph Search Pipeline leverages graph structures to perform complex queries and retrieve contextual information.

#### Key Features

- LLM-powered querying for generating Cypher queries
- Execution of structured queries on the knowledge graph
- Customizable prompts for query generation

#### KG Agent Search Pipe

The main component of the Knowledge Graph Search Pipeline is the `KGAgentSearchPipe`:

```python
class KGAgentSearchPipe(GeneratorPipe):
    async def _run_logic(
        self,
        input: GeneratorPipe.Input,
        state: AsyncState,
        run_id: uuid.UUID,
        kg_search_settings: KGSearchSettings,
        *args: Any,
        **kwargs: Any,
    ):
        # Knowledge graph search implementation
```

<Note>
To learn more about using knowledge graphs with R2R, see the [GraphRAG Cookbook](/cookbooks/knowledge-graph).
</Note>

## Combining Search Methods

The `SearchPipeline` class allows for the combination of vector and knowledge graph search methods:

```python
class SearchPipeline(Pipeline):
    async def run(
        self,
        input: Any,
        state: Optional[AsyncState] = None,
        stream: bool = False,
        run_manager: Optional[RunManager] = None,
        log_run_info: bool = True,
        vector_search_settings: VectorSearchSettings = VectorSearchSettings(),
        kg_search_settings: KGSearchSettings = KGSearchSettings(),
        *args: Any,
        **kwargs: Any,
    ):
        # Combined search pipeline implementation
```

## Customizing the Search Pipeline

The Search Pipeline can be customized by adding different pipes or implementing custom logic. Here's an example of a custom search pipeline with additional query transformation:

```python
from r2r import SearchPipeline, R2RConfig, R2RProviderFactory, R2RPipeFactory, QueryTransformPipe

# Load configuration and create providers and pipes
config = R2RConfig.from_json()
providers = R2RProviderFactory(config).create_providers()
pipes = R2RPipeFactory(config, providers).create_pipes()

# Add a custom query transformation prompt
transform_prompt = {
    "name": "custom_search_transform_prompt",
    "template": "Enhance the search query for better results:\n\nQuery: {message}\n\nEnhanced Query:\n",
    "input_types": {"message": "str"},
}
providers.prompt.add_prompt(**transform_prompt)

# Create a query transform pipe
query_transform_pipe = QueryTransformPipe(
    llm_provider=providers.llm,
    prompt_provider=providers.prompt,
    config=QueryTransformPipe.QueryTransformConfig(
        task_prompt=transform_prompt["name"]
    ),
)

# Define a custom search pipeline
class CustomSearchPipeline(SearchPipeline):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.add_pipe(query_transform_pipe)
        self.add_pipe(pipes.vector_search_pipe)
        self.add_pipe(pipes.kg_search_search_pipe)

# Use the custom pipeline
custom_pipeline = CustomSearchPipeline()
result = await custom_pipeline.run(
    input="What are the effects of climate change on biodiversity?",
    vector_search_settings=VectorSearchSettings(search_limit=5),
    kg_search_settings=KGSearchSettings(use_kg_search=True)
)
```

## Integration with R2R App

The Search Pipeline is exposed through the R2R App via the following API endpoint:

- `/v2/search`: Endpoint for performing search operations.

This endpoint is handled by the `RetrievalRouter` in the R2R App, which utilizes the `RetrievalService` to process search requests:

```python
@router.post("/search")
async def search(request: R2RSearchRequest, ...):
    return await engine.search(
        query=request.query,
        vector_search_settings=request.vector_search_settings,
        kg_search_settings=request.kg_search_settings,
        ...
    )
```

## Best Practices

1. **Efficient Indexing**: Ensure your vector database and knowledge graph are properly indexed for optimal search performance.
2. **Query Optimization**: Use query transformation techniques to enhance the quality of search queries.
3. **Balancing Methods**: Find the right balance between vector search and knowledge graph search based on your data and use case.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage issues with either search method without failing the entire search process.
5. **Monitoring**: Set up logging and monitoring to track search performance and identify areas for improvement.
6. **Scalability**: Design your custom pipes with scalability in mind, considering potential increases in query volume and complexity.
