## Introduction

R2R is a an engine for building user-facing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. At its core, R2R uses several main components to create and manage these applications: `R2RConfig`, `R2RBuilder`, `R2REngine`, `R2RApp`, and `R2R`. In this section we will explore all of these components in detail.

## Assembly Process

The following diagram illustrates how R2R assembles a user-facing application:

## R2RConfig

R2RConfig is the configuration management class for R2R applications. It serves as the central point for defining and managing all settings required by various components of the R2R system.

Key features of R2RConfig:

1. **Configurable**: R2RConfig loads its settings from a TOML file, making it easy to modify and version control.
2. **Hierarchical Structure**: The configuration is organized into sections, each corresponding to a specific aspect of the R2R system (e.g., embedding, database, logging).
3. **Default Values**: R2RConfig provides a set of default values, which can be overridden as needed.
4. **Validation**: The class includes methods to validate the configuration, ensuring all required settings are present.
5. **Type-safe Access**: Once loaded, the configuration provides type-safe access to settings, reducing the risk of runtime errors.

Example usage:
```python
config = R2RConfig.from_toml("path/to/config.toml")
embedding_model = config.embedding.base_model
max_file_size = config.app.max_file_size_in_mb
```

## R2RBuilder

R2RBuilder is the central component for assembling R2R applications, using the builder pattern. It provides a flexible way to construct and customize the R2R system.

Key features of R2RBuilder:

1. **Fluent Interface**: Allows chaining of configuration methods for easy setup.
2. **Component Overrides**: Provides methods to override default providers, pipes, and pipelines.
3. **Factory Customization**: Supports custom factory implementations for providers, pipes, and pipelines.
4. **Configuration Integration**: Uses R2RConfig to set up the system according to specified settings.

Example usage:
```python
builder = R2RBuilder(config=config)
builder.with_embedding_provider(custom_embedding_provider)
builder.with_llm_provider(custom_llm_provider)
r2r = builder.build()
```

## R2REngine

R2REngine is the core component that orchestrates the RAG functionality. It integrates various services and provides the main interface for R2R operations.

Key features of R2REngine:

1. **Service Integration**: Initializes and manages various services (ingestion, retrieval, management, auth).
2. **Async/Sync Interface**: Provides both asynchronous and synchronous methods for all operations.
3. **Extensibility**: Can be extended or overridden to add custom functionality.

Example usage:
```python
engine = R2REngine(config, providers, pipelines)
results = await engine.asearch("query")

# everything can be ran synchronously
results_sync = engine.search("query")
```

## R2RApp

R2RApp is the class responsible for setting up the FastAPI application that serves as the interface for the R2R system. It encapsulates the routing and CORS configuration for the R2R API.

Key features of R2RApp:

1. **FastAPI Integration**: Creates and configures a FastAPI application, setting up all necessary routes.
2. **Route Setup**: Automatically sets up routes for ingestion, management, retrieval, and authentication based on the provided R2REngine.
3. **CORS Configuration**: Applies CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) settings to the FastAPI application.
4. **Serving Capability**: Includes a `serve` method to easily start the FastAPI server.

Example usage:
```python
app = R2RApp(engine)
app.serve(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

## R2R

R2R is the main class that ties everything together. It serves as the primary interface for users of the R2R framework, encapsulating both the R2REngine (which handles the core RAG functionality) and the R2RApp (which provides the API interface).

Key features of R2R:

1. **Unified Interface**: Provides a single point of access to both the engine functionality and the API application.
2. **Flexible Initialization**: Can be initialized either with pre-built engine and app instances, or by providing a configuration to build these components.
3. **Attribute Delegation**: Delegates attribute access to the underlying engine, allowing direct access to engine methods.

Example usage:
```python
# Using pre-built components
engine = R2REngine(config, providers, pipelines)
app = R2RApp(engine)
r2r = R2R(engine=engine, app=app)

# Using configuration
config = R2RConfig.from_toml("path/to/config.toml")
r2r = R2R(config=config)

# Accessing engine methods
results = r2r.search("query")

# Accessing the FastAPI application
fastapi_app = r2r.fapp

# Starting the server
r2r.serve(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

By combining these core components, R2R provides a flexible and powerful system for building and deploying RAG applications. The R2RConfig allows for easy customization, the R2RBuilder facilitates the assembly process, the R2REngine provides core functionality, the R2RApp offers a robust API interface, and the R2R class brings it all together in a user-friendly package.
