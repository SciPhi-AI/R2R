## Cloud Projects

Upon successful deployment of an R2R application, you will be provided with a unique URL (e.g., https://sciphi-b30ed103-...YOUR-PROJECT...-qwpin2swwa) that serves as the endpoint for accessing and interacting with your deployed R2R project using the R2R client.

For interested developers, SciPhi provides an open-source implementation of the project dashboard on [GitHub here](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R-Application), that can be ran locally.

### Overview

Also, as soon as you have started deploying a project you will be able to navigate to it from the SciPhi home page. This will take you to the deployments project overview page at `https://app.sciphi.ai/project/b30ed103-...YOUR-PROJECT...-qwpin2swwa`, shown below.

<Note> The project overview page under development. The feature roadmap includes request analytics, resource utilization, and more. </Note>

After deployment is complete you can upload documents and chat with your R2R application directly from the cloud application.


### Document Management

The document management page for the project is located at `https://app.sciphi.ai/project/b30ed103-...YOUR-PROJECT...-qwpin2swwa/documents`.

Within this page the administrator can test the upload, update, delete, and other document functionality.

### Chat

SciPhi provides a basic chat interface with your project at `https://sciphi-b30ed103-...YOUR-PROJECT...-qwpin2swwa/chat`.

The chat interface is great for prototyping with the agentic RAG system:

### Users

Recall that a primary objective of R2R is to help with deploying user-facing applications. The cloud dashboard provides a location to track your users at `https://sciphi-b30ed103-...YOUR-PROJECT...-qwpin2swwa/users`.

<Note> User management features are under devlepment and this table will be synched to authentication information shortly. </Note>


### Logs

Every search query and subsequent search results that flow through the R2R system are logged. These logs can be viewed directly from your cloud application.

<Note> Work is underway to fully log agentic conversations. </Note>




### Settings

The configuration file for your R2R system as well as editable system prompts can be found at `https://sciphi-b30ed103-...YOUR-PROJECT...-qwpin2swwa/settings`.

### Summary
This page provides an overview of interacting with deployed R2R applications on the SciPhi cloud platform. It covers accessing your project via a unique URL, navigating to the project overview page, managing documents, using the chat interface for prototyping, tracking users, viewing logs of search queries and results, and configuring system settings.
