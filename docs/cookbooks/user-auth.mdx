## Introduction

R2R provides a complete set of user authentication and management features, allowing developers to implement secure and feature-rich authentication systems, or to integrate directly with their authentication provider of choice.

[Refer here](/documentation/deep-dive/providers/auth) for documentation on the available authentication provider options built into R2R, or [refer here](/api-reference/endpoint/register) for available auth API reference.


<Note>
When authentication is not required (require_authentication is set to false, which is the default in `r2r.toml`), unauthenticated requests will default to using the credentials of the default admin user.

This behavior ensures that operations can proceed smoothly in development or testing environments where authentication may not be enforced, but it should be used with caution in production settings.
</Note>


## Setup

Before diving into the authentication features, ensure you have R2R installed and configured as described in the [installation guide](/documentation/installation). For this guide, we'll use the default configuration. Further, `r2r serve` must be called to serve R2R in either your local environment or local Docker engine.

## Basic Usage

### User Registration and Login

Let's start by registering a new user and logging in:

```python core/examples/scripts/run_auth_workflow.py
from r2r import R2RClient

client = R2RClient("http://localhost:7272") # Replace with your R2R deployment URL

# Register a new user
user_result = client.register("user1@test.com", "password123")
# {'results': {'email': 'user1@test.com', 'id': 'bf417057-f104-4e75-8579-c74d26fcbed3', 'hashed_password': '$2b$12$p6a9glpAQaq.4uzi4gXQru6PN7WBpky/xMeYK9LShEe4ygBf1L.pK', 'is_superuser': False, 'is_active': True, 'is_verified': False, 'verification_code_expiry': None, 'name': None, 'bio': None, 'profile_picture': None, 'created_at': '2024-07-16T22:53:47.524794Z', 'updated_at': '2024-07-16T22:53:47.524794Z'}}

# Login immediately (assuming email verification is disabled)
login_result = client.login("user1@test.com", "password123")
# {'results': {'access_token': {'token': 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyMUB0ZXN0LmNvbSIsImV4cCI6MTcyMTE5OTI0Ni44Nzc2NTksInRva2VuX3R5cGUiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.P4RcCkCe0H5UHPHak7tRovIgyQcql4gB8NlqdDDk50Y', 'token_type': 'access'}, 'refresh_token': {'token': 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyMUB0ZXN0LmNvbSIsImV4cCI6MTcyMTc3NTI0NiwidG9rZW5fdHlwZSI6InJlZnJlc2gifQ.VgfZ4Lhz0f2GW41NYv6KLrMCK3CdGmGVug7eTQp0xPU', 'token_type': 'refresh'}}}
```

This code snippet demonstrates the basic user registration and login process. The `register` method creates a new user account, while the `login` method authenticates the user and returns access and refresh tokens. In the example above, it was assumed that email verification was disabled.

### Email Verification (Optional)

If email verification is enabled in your R2R configuration, you'll need to verify the user's email before they can log in:

```python
verify_result = client.verify_email("verification_code_here")
# {"results": {"message": "Email verified successfully"}}
```

### Token Refresh

After logging in, you gain immediate access to user information such as general account details, documents overview, and utility functions like token refresh:

```python
refresh_result = client.refresh_access_token()
# {'results': {'access_token': {'token': 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyMUB0ZXN0LmNvbSIsImV4cCI6MTcyMTIwMTk3Mi4zMzI4NTIsInRva2VuX3R5cGUiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.Ze9A50kefndAtu2tvcvMCiilFfAhrOV0l5A7RZgPvBY', 'token_type': 'access'}, 'refresh_token': {'token': 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyMUB0ZXN0LmNvbSIsImV4cCI6MTcyMTc3Nzk3MiwidG9rZW5fdHlwZSI6InJlZnJlc2gifQ.NwzFH8e2tKO0bH1Hdm_eq39VqmGPf7xSNOOhDlKFQFQ', 'token_type': 'refresh'}}}
```


## Document Management

R2R allows users to manage their documents securely. Here's how to ingest and search a given users documents:

### Ingesting Documents

```python
import os

# Ingest a sample file for the logged-in user
script_path = os.path.dirname(__file__)
sample_file = os.path.join(script_path, "..", "data", "aristotle.txt")
ingestion_result = client.ingest_files([sample_file])
# {'results': {'processed_documents': ["Document 'aristotle.txt' processed successfully."], 'failed_documents': [], 'skipped_documents': []}}
```

### User Document Overview
```python
documents_overview = client.documents_overview()
# {'results': [{'document_id': '6ab698c6-e494-5441-a740-49395f2b1881', 'version': 'v0', 'size_in_bytes': 73353, 'metadata': {}, 'status': 'success', 'user_id': 'ba0c75eb-0b21-4eb1-a902-082476e5e972', 'title': 'aristotle.txt', 'created_at': '2024-07-16T16:25:27.634411Z', 'updated_at': '2024-07-16T16:25:27.634411Z'}]}
```
### Search & RAG

```python
search_result = client.search(query="Sample search query")

## Advanced Authentication Features

R2R offers several advanced authentication features to enhance security and user experience:

### Password Management

Users can change their passwords and request password resets:

```python
# Change password
change_password_result = client.change_password("password123", "new_password")
# {"result": {"message": "Password changed successfully"}}

# Request password reset
reset_request_result = client.request_password_reset("user@example.com")
# {"result": {"message": "If the email exists, a reset link has been sent"}}

# Confirm password reset (after user receives reset token)
reset_confirm_result = client.confirm_password_reset("reset_token_here", "new_password")
# {"result": {"message": "Password reset successfully"}}
```

### User Profile Management

Users can view and update their profiles:

```python
# Get user profile
profile = client.user()
# {'results': {'email': 'user1@test.com', 'id': '76eea168-9f98-4672-af3b-2c26ec92d7f8', 'hashed_password': 'null', 'is_superuser': False, 'is_active': True, 'is_verified': True, 'verification_code_expiry': None, 'name': None, 'bio': None, 'profile_picture': None, 'created_at': '2024-07-16T23:06:42.123303Z', 'updated_at': '2024-07-16T23:22:48.256239Z'}}

# Update user profile
update_result = client.update_user(name="John Doe", bio="R2R enthusiast")
# {'results': {'email': 'user1@test.com', 'id': '76eea168-9f98-4672-af3b-2c26ec92d7f8', 'hashed_password': 'null', 'is_superuser': False, 'is_active': True, 'is_verified': True, 'verification_code_expiry': None, 'name': 'John Doe', 'bio': 'R2R enthusiast', 'profile_picture': None, 'created_at': '2024-07-16T23:06:42.123303Z', 'updated_at': '2024-07-16T23:22:48.256239Z'}}
```

### Account Deletion

Users can delete their accounts:

```python
# Delete account (requires password confirmation)
user_id = register_response["results"]["id"] # input unique id here
delete_result = client.delete_user(user_id, "password123")
# {'results': {'message': 'User account deleted successfully'}}
```

### Logout

To end a user session:

```python
logout_result = client.logout()
print(f"Logout Result:\n{logout_result}")
# {'results': {'message': 'Logged out successfully'}}
```

## Superuser Capabilities and Default Admin Creation

R2R includes powerful superuser capabilities and a mechanism for default admin creation, which are crucial for system management and initial setup. Let's explore these features:

### Superuser Capabilities

Superusers in R2R have elevated privileges that allow them to perform system-wide operations and access sensitive information. Some key superuser capabilities include:

1. **User Management**: Superusers can view, modify, and delete user accounts.
2. **System-wide Document Access**: They can access and manage documents across all users.
3. **Analytics and Observability**: Superusers have access to system-wide analytics and logs.
4. **Configuration Management**: They can modify system configurations and settings.

To use superuser capabilities, you need to authenticate as a superuser. The methods for accessing these features are the same as regular user methods, but with expanded scope and permissions.

### Default Admin Creation

R2R automatically creates a default admin user during initialization. This process is handled by the `R2RAuthProvider` class. Here's how it works:

1. During system initialization, R2R attempts to create a default admin user.
2. The admin email and password are typically set through environment variables or configuration files.
3. If the admin user already exists, R2R logs this information and continues without creating a duplicate.

The relevant part of the configuration that affects this process is:

```toml
[auth]
provider = "r2r"
access_token_lifetime_in_minutes = 60
refresh_token_lifetime_in_days = 7
require_authentication = true
require_email_verification = false
default_admin_email = "admin@example.com"
default_admin_password = "change_me_immediately"
```

- With `"require_authentication": false`, the system allows unauthenticated access for testing and development. In a production environment, this should be set to `true`.
- `"require_email_verification": false` means that email verification is not required for new users, including the default admin. For increased security in production, consider enabling this.

### Accessing Superuser Features

To access superuser features, you need to authenticate as the default admin or another user with superuser privileges. Here's an example of how to do this:

```python

from r2r import R2RClient

client = R2RClient("http://localhost:7272")

# Login as admin
login_result = client.login("admin@example.com", "change_me_immediately")

# Now you can access superuser features, for example:
users_overview = client.users_overview()
# {'results': [{'user_id': '2acb499e-8428-543b-bd85-0d9098718220', 'num_files': 2, 'total_size_in_bytes': 73672, 'document_ids': ['c4967f03-1780-5161-8e1d-57b55aa65076', '9fbe403b-c11c-5aae-8ade-ef22980c3ad1']}, {'user_id': 'ac730ec3-7d3d-451a-a166-e7ac7c57b198', 'num_files': 1, 'total_size_in_bytes': 73353, 'document_ids': ['d4861e78-cf02-5184-9b6a-d5bdbddd39b2']}, {'user_id': 'e0514342-e51a-43e5-8aaa-665468102dce', 'num_files': 1, 'total_size_in_bytes': 73353, 'document_ids': ['f4fbe534-b7d6-5fec-9d41-9093b2112732']}]}

# Access system-wide logs
logs = client.logs()
# {'results': [{'run_id': '645cb90f-c281-4188-b93b-94fb383170f6', 'run_type': 'search', 'entries': [{'key': 'search_latency', 'value': '0.43'}, { ...

    {"search_latencies": ["basic_statistics", "search_latency"]}
)

### Security Considerations for Superusers

When using superuser capabilities, keep the following security considerations in mind:

1. **Limit Superuser Access**: Only grant superuser privileges to trusted individuals who require full system access.
2. **Use Strong Passwords**: Ensure that superuser accounts, especially the default admin, use strong, unique passwords.
3. **Enable Authentication and Verification**: In production, set `"require_authentication": true` and `"require_email_verification": true` for enhanced security.
4. **Audit Superuser Actions**: Regularly review logs of superuser activities to detect any unusual or unauthorized actions.
5. **Rotate Credentials**: Periodically update superuser credentials, including the default admin password.

By understanding and properly managing superuser capabilities and default admin creation, you can ensure secure and effective administration of your R2R deployment.

## Security Considerations

When implementing user authentication, consider the following security best practices:

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production to encrypt data in transit.
2. **Implement rate limiting**: Protect against brute-force attacks by limiting login attempts.
3. **Use secure password hashing**: R2R uses bcrypt for password hashing by default, which is a secure choice.
4. **Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)**: Consider adding MFA for an extra layer of security.
5. **Regular security audits**: Conduct regular security audits of your authentication system.

## Customizing Authentication

R2R's authentication system is flexible and can be customized to fit your specific needs:

1. **Custom user fields**: Extend the User model to include additional fields.
2. **OAuth integration**: Integrate with third-party OAuth providers for social login.
3. **Custom password policies**: Implement custom password strength requirements.
4. **User roles and permissions**: Implement a role-based access control system.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and their solutions:

1. **Login fails after registration**: Ensure email verification is completed if enabled.
2. **Token refresh fails**: Check if the refresh token has expired; the user may need to log in again.
3. **Unable to change password**: Verify that the current password is correct.

## Conclusion

R2R provides a comprehensive set of user authentication and management features, allowing developers to create secure and user-friendly applications. By leveraging these capabilities, you can implement robust user authentication, document management, and access control in your R2R-based projects.

For more advanced use cases or custom implementations, refer to the R2R documentation or reach out to the community for support.
