This cookbook demonstrates how to use the agentic capabilities which ship by default in R2R. The R2R agent is an intelligent system that can formulate its own questions, search for information, and provide informed responses based on the retrieved context. It can be customized on the fly.

<Note> Agents in the R2R framework are still in beta. Please let us know what you like/dislike and what features you would like to see added. </Note>

## Understanding R2R's RAG Agent

R2R's RAG agent is designed to provide powerful, context-aware responses by combining large language models with a search capability over your ingested documents. When you initialize an R2R application, it automatically creates a RAG assistant that's ready to use.
R2R plans to extend its agent functionality to mirror core features supported by OpenAI and more, including:

- Multiple tool support (e.g., code interpreter, file search)
- Persistent conversation threads
- Complete end to end observability of agent interactions


R2R also provides support for local RAG capabilities, allowing you to create AI agents that can access and reason over your local document store, entirely offline.

The RAG agent is also available for use through the R2R API, specifically via the `agent` endpoint.

## Using the RAG Agent

Now, let's use the RAG agent to answer questions:

```python
def rag_agent_example():
    # Prepare messages for the chat
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Who is the greatest philospher of all time?",
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Aristotle is widely considered the greatest philospher of all time.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Can you tell me more about him?",
        },
    ]

    # Use the RAG assistant via the agent endpoint
    response = client.agent(
        messages=messages,
        vector_search_settings={"search_limit": 5, "search_filters": {}},
        kg_search_settings={"use_kg_search": False},
        rag_generation_config={"max_tokens": 300}
    )

    print("RAG Assistant Response:")
    # Note, response includes the full conversation, including steps taken by the assistant to produce the final result.
    print(response)

# Run the example
rag_agent_example()

```

In this example, the agent might formulate its own questions to gather more information before providing a response. For instance, it could ask the search tool about Aristotle's scientific works or his methods of inquiry.

## Streaming Responses

To see the agent's thought process in real-time, you can use streaming responses:

```python
def streaming_rag_agent_example():
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful agent with access to a large knowledge base. You can ask questions to gather more information if needed."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What were Aristotle's main philosophical ideas?"},
    ]

    streaming_response = client.agent(
        messages=messages,
        vector_search_settings={"search_limit": 5, "search_filters": {}},
        kg_search_settings={"use_kg_search": False},
        rag_generation_config={"max_tokens": 300, "stream": True}
    )

    print("Streaming RAG Assistant Response:")
    for chunk in streaming_response:
        print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
    print()  # New line after streaming response

streaming_rag_agent_example()

# Streaming RAG Assistant Response:

# <function_call><name>search</name><arguments>{"query":"Aristotle's main philosophical ideas"}</arguments><results>1. Politics
# Main article: Politics (Aristotle)
# 2. Ethics
# Main article: Aristotelian ethics
# Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, most notably including the Nicomachean Ethics.[117]
# 3. Metaphysics
# Main article: Metaphysics (Aristotle)
# The word "metaphysics" appears to have been coined by the first century AD editor who assembled various small selections of Aristotle's works to the treatise we know by the name Metaphysics.[34] Aristotle called it "first philosophy", and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science (physics) as the contemplative (theoretikē) philosophy which is "theological" and studies the divine. He wrote in his Metaphysics (1026a16):
# 4. Practical philosophy
# Aristotle's practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics, politics, economics, and rhetoric.[40]
# 5. Aristotle[A] (Greek: Ἀριστοτέλης Aristotélēs, pronounced [aristotélɛːs]; 384–322 BC) was an Ancient Greek philosopher and polymath. His writings cover a broad range of subjects spanning the natural sciences, philosophy, linguistics, economics, politics, psychology, and the arts. As the founder of the Peripatetic school of philosophy in the Lyceum in Athens, he began the wider Aristotelian tradition that followed, which set the groundwork for the development of modern science.
# </results></function_call>Aristotle, an ancient Greek philosopher, made significant contributions across various fields of philosophy. Here are some of his main philosophical ideas:
#
# 1. **Metaphysics**: Aristotle's metaphysics, often referred to as "first philosophy," deals with the nature of reality, existence, and the fundamental nature of being. He introduced the concept of substance and essence, and his work laid the groundwork for later metaphysical thought [Metaphysics (Aristotle)].
#
# 2. **Ethics**: Aristotle's ethical philosophy is primarily outlined in his work "Nicomachean Ethics." He emphasized the concept of virtue ethics, which focuses on the development of good character traits (virtues) and living a life of moral excellence. He believed that the ultimate goal of human life is eudaimonia, often translated as "happiness" or "flourishing," achieved through virtuous living [Aristotelian ethics].
#
# 3. **Politics**: In his work "Politics," Aristotle explored the nature of human communities and the role of the state. He believed that humans are naturally political animals and that the state exists to promote the good life. He analyzed different forms of government and advocated for a constitutional government that balances the interests of different social classes [Politics (Aristotle)].
#
# 4. **Practical Philosophy**: Aristotle's practical philosophy encompasses ethics, politics, economics, and rhetoric. He believed that philosophy should be practical and aimed at improving human life and society [Practical philosophy].
#
# 5. **Natural Sciences**: Aristotle made substantial contributions to the natural sciences, including biology, physics, and astronomy. He conducted empirical observations and classified various forms of life, laying the foundation for the scientific method [Aristotle's contributions to natural sciences].

# Aristotle's extensive body of work has had a profound and lasting impact on Western philosophy and science, influencing countless thinkers and shaping the development of various academic disciplines.

```

This will produce a streaming response, showing the agent's thought process, including its search queries and the gradual construction of its response.

## Customizing the RAG Agent
<Warning> This section is still under development, please proceed carefully when customizing agents.</Warning>
You can customize various aspects of the RAG agent's behavior:

```python
custom_response = client.agent(
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert on ancient Greek philosophy. Ask clarifying questions if needed."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Compare Aristotle's and Plato's views on the nature of reality."},
    ],
    vector_search_settings={"search_limit": 25, "use_hybrid_search": True, "search_filters": {"category": "philosophy"}},
    kg_search_settings={"use_kg_search": False},
    rag_generation_config={
        "max_tokens": 500,
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "model": "openai/gpt-4o"  # Assuming you have access to GPT-4
    }
)

print("Customized RAG Agent Response:")
print(custom_response)
```

This example demonstrates how to:
- Set custom search filters
- Enable hybrid search (combining vector and keyword search)
- Adjust the number of search results
- Customize the generation config
- Use a specific model for the response

...

## Advanced Usage: Customizing R2R's RAG Agent

For developers who need deep customization of the RAG process, R2R allows you to extend the `R2RStreamingRAGAssistant` class and add custom tools. You can then use the `R2RBuilder` to integrate your custom assistant into the R2R framework. Here's an example of how to create a custom RAG assistant with additional tools:

```python
from r2r import R2RBuilder, R2RConfig
from r2r.assistants import R2RStreamingRAGAssistant
from r2r.base import Tool, LLMProvider, PromptProvider, AssistantConfig
from r2r.pipelines import SearchPipeline
import asyncio

class CustomRAGAssistant(R2RStreamingRAGAssistant):
    def __init__(
        self,
        llm_provider: LLMProvider,
        prompt_provider: PromptProvider,
        search_pipeline: SearchPipeline,
        config: AssistantConfig,
    ):
        super().__init__(
            llm_provider=llm_provider,
            prompt_provider=prompt_provider,
            search_pipeline=search_pipeline,
            config=config,
        )
        self.add_custom_tools()

    def add_custom_tools(self):
        calculator_tool = Tool(
            name="calculator",
            description="Perform basic arithmetic operations",
            function=self.calculate,
            parameters={
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "operation": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "enum": ["add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide"],
                        "description": "The arithmetic operation to perform",
                    },
                    "num1": {"type": "number", "description": "The first number"},
                    "num2": {"type": "number", "description": "The second number"},
                },
                "required": ["operation", "num1", "num2"],
            },
        )
        self.config.tools.append(calculator_tool)

    async def calculate(self, operation: str, num1: float, num2: float) -> str:
        if operation == "add":
            result = num1 + num2
        elif operation == "subtract":
            result = num1 - num2
        elif operation == "multiply":
            result = num1 * num2
        elif operation == "divide":
            if num2 == 0:
                return "Error: Division by zero"
            result = num1 / num2
        else:
            return "Error: Invalid operation"

        return f"The result of {operation} {num1} and {num2} is {result}"

# Custom assistant factory
def create_custom_assistant(
    llm_provider: LLMProvider,
    prompt_provider: PromptProvider,
    search_pipeline: SearchPipeline,
    config: AssistantConfig,
):
    return CustomRAGAssistant(
        llm_provider=llm_provider,
        prompt_provider=prompt_provider,
        search_pipeline=search_pipeline,
        config=config,
    )

# Build custom R2R instance with the custom assistant
custom_r2r = (
    R2RBuilder(config_name="default")
    .with_assistant_factory(create_custom_assistant)
    .build()
)

# Use the custom R2R instance
async def custom_rag_agent_example():
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant with access to a large knowledge base and a calculator."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the square root of 144, and who discovered it?"},
    ]

    response = await custom_r2r.engine.agent(
        messages=messages,
        rag_generation_config={"max_tokens": 300, "temperature": 0.7, "stream": True},
        vector_search_settings={"use_vector_search": True, "search_limit": 5},
        kg_search_settings={"use_kg_search": True},
    )

    print("Custom RAG Agent Response:")
    async for chunk in response:
        print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
    print()

# Run the example
asyncio.run(custom_rag_agent_example())
```

This example demonstrates how to:

1. Create a `CustomRAGAssistant` class that inherits from `R2RStreamingRAGAssistant`.
2. Add a custom calculator tool to the assistant.
3. Implement the `calculate` method to handle arithmetic operations.
4. Create a custom assistant factory function.
5. Use the `R2RBuilder` to integrate the custom assistant into R2R.
6. Use the custom R2R instance to perform a RAG chat operation.

Key points about this approach:

- **Extensibility**: You can add any number of custom tools to your assistant, expanding its capabilities beyond the default RAG functionality.
- **Inheritance**: By inheriting from `R2RStreamingRAGAssistant`, you maintain all the core RAG capabilities while adding your own features.
- **Integration**: The `R2RBuilder` allows you to seamlessly integrate your custom assistant into the R2R framework.
- **Flexibility**: This approach allows you to customize not just the tools, but also the behavior of the assistant itself if needed.

To further customize your RAG assistant, you can:

- Add more complex tools that interact with external APIs or databases.
- Implement custom pre-processing or post-processing logic for the assistant's responses.
- Override methods from the base `R2RStreamingRAGAssistant` class to modify core behaviors.

By extending the `R2RStreamingRAGAssistant` and using the `R2RBuilder`, you have the flexibility to create highly customized RAG assistants while still benefiting from R2R's robust architecture and built-in functionality.

This direct API call gives you full control over the request parameters and can be useful for debugging or when integrating R2R's RAG capabilities into other applications.

## Conclusion

The R2R RAG assistant is a powerful tool that combines large language models with advanced search capabilities. By leveraging your ingested documents and the flexible `agent` endpoint, you can create dynamic, context-aware conversational experiences.

Key takeaways:
1. R2R automatically creates a RAG assistant when initializing the application.
2. The `agent` endpoint provides easy access to the RAG assistant's capabilities.
3. You can customize various aspects of the assistant's behavior, including search settings and generation parameters.
4. Streaming responses allow for real-time interaction and visibility into the assistant's thought process.

Experiment with different settings and configurations to find the optimal setup for your specific use case. Remember to keep your ingested documents up-to-date to ensure the assistant has access to the most relevant and recent information.
