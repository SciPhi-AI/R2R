### Installing and Running the R2R Dashboard

If you're running R2R with the Docker, you already have the R2R dashboard running! Just navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

If you're running R2R outside of Docker, run the following commands to install the R2R Dashboard.

1. Clone the project repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SciPhi-AI/R2R-Application.git
cd R2R-Application
```

2. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Build and start the application for production:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

The dashboard will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Features

### Login

To interact with R2R with the dashboard, you must first login. If it's your first time logging in, log in with the default credentials shown.

By default, an R2R instance is hosted on port 8000. The login page will include this URL by default, but be sure to update the URL if your R2R instance is deployed elsewhere. For information about deploying a local R2R application server, see the [quickstart](/documentation/quickstart).
