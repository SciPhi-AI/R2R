## Introduction

R2R provides robust group management features, allowing developers to implement efficient access control and organization of users and documents. This cookbook will guide you through the group permissioning capabilities of R2R.

For user authentication and management, please refer to the [User Auth Cookbook](/cookbooks/user-auth).

<Note>
Group permissioning in R2R is still under development and as a result the API will likely evolve.
</Note>

## Setup

Ensure you have R2R installed and configured as described in the [installation guide](/documentation/installation). For this guide, we'll use the default configuration. Make sure `r2r serve` is running in your local environment or local Docker engine.

## Basic Usage

<Info>
Groups currently follow a flat hierarchy wherein superusers are responsible for management operations. This functionality will expand as development on R2R continues.
</Info>

### Creating a Group

Let's start by creating a new group:

```python
from r2r import R2RClient

client = R2RClient("http://localhost:8000")  # Replace with your R2R deployment URL

# Assuming you're logged in as an admin or a user with appropriate permissions
# For testing, the default R2R implementation will grant superuser privileges to anon api calls
group_result = client.create_group("Marketing Team", "Group for marketing department")
print(f"Group creation result: {group_result}")
# {'results': {'group_id': '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000', 'name': 'Marketing Team', 'description': 'Group for marketing department', 'created_at': '2024-07-16T22:53:47.524794Z', 'updated_at': '2024-07-16T22:53:47.524794Z'}}
```

### Getting Group Details

To retrieve details about a specific group:

```python
group_id = '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'  # Use the group_id from the creation result
group_details = client.get_group(group_id)
print(f"Group details: {group_details}")
# {'results': {'group_id': '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000', 'name': 'Marketing Team', 'description': 'Group for marketing department', 'created_at': '2024-07-16T22:53:47.524794Z', 'updated_at': '2024-07-16T22:53:47.524794Z'}}
```

### Updating a Group

You can update a group's name or description:

```python
update_result = client.update_group(group_id, name="Updated Marketing Team", description="New description for marketing team")
print(f"Group update result: {update_result}")
# {'results': {'group_id': '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000', 'name': 'Updated Marketing Team', 'description': 'New description for marketing team', 'created_at': '2024-07-16T22:53:47.524794Z', 'updated_at': '2024-07-16T23:15:30.123456Z'}}
```

### Listing Groups

To get a list of all groups:

```python
groups_list = client.list_groups()
print(f"Groups list: {groups_list}")
# {'results': [{'group_id': '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000', 'name': 'Updated Marketing Team', 'description': 'New description for marketing team', 'created_at': '2024-07-16T22:53:47.524794Z', 'updated_at': '2024-07-16T23:15:30.123456Z'}, ...]}
```

## User Management in Groups

### Adding a User to a Group

To add a user to a group, you need both the user's ID and the group's ID:

```python
user_id = '456e789f-g01h-34i5-j678-901234567890'  # This should be a valid user ID
add_user_result = client.add_user_to_group(user_id, group_id)
print(f"Add user to group result: {add_user_result}")
# {'results': {'message': 'User successfully added to the group'}}
```

### Removing a User from a Group

Similarly, to remove a user from a group:

```python
remove_user_result = client.remove_user_from_group(user_id, group_id)
print(f"Remove user from group result: {remove_user_result}")
# {'results': {'message': 'User successfully removed from the group'}}
```

### Listing Users in a Group

To get a list of all users in a specific group:

```python
users_in_group = client.get_users_in_group(group_id)
print(f"Users in group: {users_in_group}")
# {'results': [{'user_id': '456e789f-g01h-34i5-j678-901234567890', 'email': 'user@example.com', 'name': 'John Doe', ...}, ...]}
```

### Getting Groups for a User

To get all groups that a user is a member of:

```python
user_groups = client.user_groups(user_id)
print(f"User's groups: {user_groups}")
# {'results': [{'group_id': '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000', 'name': 'Updated Marketing Team', ...}, ...]}
```

## Document Management in Groups

### Assigning a Document to a Group

To assign a document to a group:

```python
document_id = '789g012j-k34l-56m7-n890-123456789012'  # This should be a valid document ID
assign_doc_result = client.assign_document_to_group(document_id, group_id)
print(f"Assign document to group result: {assign_doc_result}")
# {'results': {'message': 'Document successfully assigned to the group'}}
```

### Removing a Document from a Group

To remove a document from a group:

```python
remove_doc_result = client.remove_document_from_group(document_id, group_id)
print(f"Remove document from group result: {remove_doc_result}")
# {'results': {'message': 'Document successfully removed from the group'}}
```

### Listing Documents in a Group

To get a list of all documents in a specific group:

```python
docs_in_group = client.documents_in_group(group_id)
print(f"Documents in group: {docs_in_group}")
# {'results': [{'document_id': '789g012j-k34l-56m7-n890-123456789012', 'title': 'Marketing Strategy 2024', ...}, ...]}
```

### Getting Groups for a Document

To get all groups that a document is assigned to:

```python
document_groups = client.document_groups(document_id)
print(f"Document's groups: {document_groups}")
# {'results': [{'group_id': '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000', 'name': 'Updated Marketing Team', ...}, ...]}
```

## Advanced Group Management

### Group Overview

To get an overview of groups, including user and document counts:

```python
groups_overview = client.groups_overview()
print(f"Groups overview: {groups_overview}")
# {'results': [{'group_id': '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000', 'name': 'Updated Marketing Team', 'description': 'New description for marketing team', 'user_count': 5, 'document_count': 10, ...}, ...]}
```

### Deleting a Group

To delete a group:

```python
delete_result = client.delete_group(group_id)
print(f"Delete group result: {delete_result}")
# {'results': {'message': 'Group successfully deleted'}}
```

## Pagination and Filtering

Many of the group-related methods support pagination and filtering. Here are some examples:

```python
# List groups with pagination
paginated_groups = client.list_groups(offset=10, limit=20)

# Get users in a group with pagination
paginated_users = client.get_users_in_group(group_id, offset=5, limit=10)

# Get documents in a group with pagination
paginated_docs = client.documents_in_group(group_id, offset=0, limit=50)

# Get groups overview with specific group IDs
specific_groups_overview = client.groups_overview(group_ids=['id1', 'id2', 'id3'])
```

## Security Considerations

When implementing group permissions, consider the following security best practices:

1. **Least Privilege Principle**: Assign the minimum necessary permissions to users and groups.
2. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review group memberships and document assignments.
3. **Access Control**: Ensure that only authorized users (e.g., admins) can perform group management operations.
4. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging for all group-related actions.

## Customizing Group Permissions

While R2R's current group system follows a flat hierarchy, you can build more complex permission structures on top of it:

1. **Custom Roles**: Implement application-level roles within groups (e.g., group admin, editor, viewer).
2. **Hierarchical Groups**: Create a hierarchy by establishing parent-child relationships between groups in your application logic.
3. **Permission Inheritance**: Implement rules for permission inheritance based on group memberships.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and their solutions:

1. **Unable to Create/Modify Groups**: Ensure the user has superuser privileges.
2. **User Not Seeing Group Content**: Verify that the user is correctly added to the group and that documents are properly assigned.
3. **Performance Issues with Large Groups**: Use pagination when retrieving users or documents in large groups.

## Conclusion

R2R's group permissioning system provides a foundation for implementing sophisticated access control in your applications. As the feature set evolves, more advanced capabilities will become available. Stay tuned to the R2R documentation for updates and new features related to group permissions.

For user authentication and individual user management, refer to the [User Auth Cookbook](/cookbooks/user-auth). For more advanced use cases or custom implementations, consult the R2R documentation or reach out to the community for support.
