## Introduction 

GraphRAG is a powerful feature of R2R that allows you to perform graph-based search and retrieval. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and using Graph RAG using R2R. 

<Note> This cookbook assumes that you have already created a knowledge graph using R2R. If not, please refer to the [knowledge graph](/cookbooks/knowledge-graph) cookbook. </Note>

In this example, we'll query over the graph of YC Summer 2024 startups. You can interact with the graph using neo4j [here](https://sciphi.ai/graph-rag-demo).

<Info>
Knowledge graphs in R2R are still underdevelopment. Related API and interfaces are likely to evolve. Further, permisisoning is not yet supported over created graphs.
</Info>

<Note>
Note that you may get limited performance on GraphRAG if your graphs were created using local models. For this cookbook, we recommend constructing your graph using gpt-4o-mini.
</Note>


## Start server 

First you start your server with the same configuration that was used in the [knowledge graph](/cookbooks/knowledge-graph) cookbook. 


```bash
r2r serve --config-name=neo4j_kg
```

## Graph Enrichment

The ingestion from the last cookbook has created a graph with nodes and relationships. Now we will run the graph enrichment step which adds node and relationship description summaries, performs hierarchical leiden clustering, and creates embeddings of their descriptions. These embeddings will be used later in the local search stage of the pipeline. If you are more interested in the algorithm, please refer to the blog post [here](https://www.sciphi.ai/blog/graphrag).

```bash
r2r enrich-graph
```

### Visualization

The graph should now be ready to use. You can visualize it in the neo4j browser or using the following command. 

```bash
r2r inspect-knowledge-graph 
```

The output should be as follows:

```
== Lilac Labs ==
  Offers:
    - Voice AI Drive-Thru Solution
  Co-Founder:
    - Tony
    - Shelden

== Lumenary ==
  Founded by:
    - Daniel DiPietro
  HAS_PARTNER:
    - Surbhi Sarna

== Daniel DiPietro ==
  Co-founder:
    - Lumenary

== Ziray Hao ==
  Co-founder:
    - Lumenary

== Vivek Hazari ==
  Co-founder and CEO:
    - Lumenary
  Former Employee:  
    - Palantir Technologies
```

## Search 

GraphRAG currently supports two types of searches: local and global. 


### Local search

Local searches are faster and cheaper, they perform similarity search on the entity, relationship and community description embeddings. 

```bash 
r2r search --query="What does Parley do?" --use-kg-search --kg-search-type=local
```

The answer will be returned in JSON format and contains results from entities, relationships and communities. Following is a snippet of the output:  

```json
{
  "Parley": {
    "name": "Parley",
    "description": "Parley is a San Francisco-based startup founded in 2024 that specializes in automating visa application processes to enhance the efficiency of immigration attorneys. The company, which is part of Y Combinator's S24 cohort, develops tools like the O-1A Visa Writer to streamline the drafting of visa petitions. With a small team of three co-founders, including Ian Edwards, Jackson, and Philip, Parley aims to simplify immigration complexities through innovative legaltech solutions."
  }
}
```

### Global search

Global searches can be used for queries that require reasoning over the whole dataset. They provide more accurate results, however they use a large amount of queries and are expensive. We recommend checking the number of clusters created in the graph and setting the `max-llm-queries` to be a fraction (> 0.1) of that number.

```bash 
r2r search --query="In this batch, which companies are building AI agents?" --use-kg-search --kg-search-type=global --max-llm-queries-for-global-search=100
```

The answer will be returned in markdown format as follows:
