## Introduction

GraphRAG is a powerful feature of R2R that allows you to perform graph-based search and retrieval. This guide will walk you through the process of setting it up and running your first queries.

</Frame>

<Note>
Note that graph construction may take long for local LLMs, we recommend using cloud LLMs for faster results.
</Note>


## Start server

We provide three configurations for R2R Light, R2R Light with Local LLMs, and R2R Full with Docker+Hatchet. If you want to get started quickly, we recommend using R2R Light. If you want to run large graph workloads, we recommend using R2R Full with Docker+Hatchet.

## Ingesting files

We begin the cookbook by ingesting the default sample file `aristotle.txt` used across R2R tutorials and cookbooks:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="CLI">
```bash
r2r ingest-sample-file
# or
r2r ingest-files /path/to/your/files_or_directory

# Example Response
[{'message': 'Ingestion task queued successfully.', 'task_id': '2b16bb55-4f47-4e66-a6bd-da9e215b9793', 'document_id': '9fbe403b-c11c-5aae-8ade-ef22980c3ad1'}]
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="SDK">
```python
from r2r import R2RClient

import requests
import tempfile
import os

# URL of the raw content on GitHub
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R/main/py/core/examples/data/aristotle.txt"

# Fetch the content
response = requests.get(url)
content = response.text

# Create a temporary file
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', delete=False, suffix='.txt', prefix='aristotle_') as temp_file:
    # Write the content to the temporary file
    temp_file.write(content)
    temp_file_path = temp_file.name

client = R2RClient("http://localhost:7272")
client.ingest_files([temp_file_path])

# Example Response
[{'message': 'Ingestion task queued successfully.', 'task_id': '2b16bb55-4f47-4e66-a6bd-da9e215b9793', 'document_id': '9fbe403b-c11c-5aae-8ade-ef22980c3ad1'}]
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

The initial ingestion step adds parses the given documents and inserts them into R2R's relational and vector databases, enabling document management and semantic search over them. The `aristotle.txt` example file is typically ingested in under 10s. You can confirm ingestion is complete by querying the documents overview table:

```bash
r2r documents-overview

# Example Response
{'id': '9fbe403b-c11c-5aae-8ade-ef22980c3ad1', 'title': 'aristotle.txt', 'user_id': '2acb499e-8428-543b-bd85-0d9098718220', 'type': 'txt', 'created_at': '2024-09-05T18:20:47.921933Z', 'updated_at': '2024-09-05T18:20:47.921938Z', 'ingestion_status': 'success', 'restructuring_status': 'pending', 'version': 'v0', 'collection_ids': [], 'metadata': {'version': 'v0'}}
```

When ingestion completes successfully for a given file we will find that `ingestion_status` reads `success` in the corresponding output. You can also view in R2R's dashboard on http://localhost:7273 that the file has been ingested.

## Create Knowledge Graph

Knowledge graph creation is done in two steps:

1. `create-graph`: Extracts nodes and relationships from your input document collection.
2. `enrich-graph`: Enhances the graph structure through clustering and explaining entities (commonly referred to as `GraphRAG`).


<Tabs>
<Tab title="CLI">
```bash
# Cost Estimation step.
# collection ID is optional. If you don't specify one, the default collection will be used.
r2r create-graph --collection-id=122fdf6a-e116-546b-a8f6-e4cb2e2c0a09

This will run a cost estimation step to give you an estimate of the cost of the graph creation process.

```
</Tab>

</Tabs>

If you are using R2R Full, you can log into the hatchet dashboard on http://localhost:7274 (admin@example.com / Admin123!!) to check the status of the graph creation process. Please make sure all the `kg-extract-*` tasks are completed before running the enrich-graph step.

![Hatchet Dashboard](../images/kg_extraction_progress.png)


This step will create a knowledge graph with nodes and relationships. You can get the entities and relationships in the graph using our dashboard on http://localhost:7273 or by calling the following API endpoints. These hit the /v2/entities and /v2/triples endpoints respectively. This will by default use the `entity_level=document` query parameter to get the entities and triples at the document level. We will set the default collection id to `122fdf6a-e116-546b-a8f6-e4cb2e2c0a09` in the examples below.

- Entities: [Entities](http://localhost:7272/v2/entities?collection_id=122fdf6a-e116-546b-a8f6-e4cb2e2c0a09&entity_level=document)
- Triples: [Triples](http://localhost:7272/v2/triples?collection_id=122fdf6a-e116-546b-a8f6-e4cb2e2c0a09&entity_level=document)


## Entity Deduplication

Note that the entities and triples are created at the document level. This means that if you have multiple documents with the same entity, the entity will be duplicated for each document.

To deduplicate the entities, you can run the `deduplicate-entities` endpoint. This endpoint will merge duplicate entities and delete the duplicate entities.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="CLI">
```bash
r2r deduplicate-entities --collection-id=122fdf6a-e116-546b-a8f6-e4cb2e2c0a09

# Example Response
[{'message': 'Deduplication task queued successfully.', 'task_id': 'd9dae1bb-5862-4a16-abaf-5297024df390'}]
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="SDK">
```python
from r2r import R2RClient

client = R2RClient("http://localhost:7272")
client.deduplicate_entities(collection_id="122fdf6a-e116-546b-a8f6-e4cb2e2c0a09")

# Example Response
[{'message': 'Deduplication task queued successfully.', 'task_id': 'd9dae1bb-5862-4a16-abaf-5297024df390'}]
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

You can check the status of the deduplication task using the hatchet dashboard on http://localhost:7274. And once that is complete, check the endpoints at a entity_level = collection to see the deduplicated entities and triples.

- Entities: [Entities](http://localhost:7272/v2/entities?collection_id=122fdf6a-e116-546b-a8f6-e4cb2e2c0a09&entity_level=collection)
- Triples: [Triples](http://localhost:7272/v2/triples?collection_id=122fdf6a-e116-546b-a8f6-e4cb2e2c0a09&entity_level=collection)


## Graph Enrichment

Now we have a searchable graph, but this graph is not enriched yet. It does not have any community level information. We will now run the enrichment step.

The graph enrichment step performs hierarchical leiden clustering to create communities, and embeds the descriptions. These embeddings will be used later in the local search stage of the pipeline. If you are more interested in the algorithm, please refer to the blog post [here](https://www.sciphi.ai/blog/graphrag).

<Tabs>
<Tab title="CLI">
```bash
# collection ID is optional. If you don't specify one, the default collection will be used.
r2r enrich-graph --collection-id=122fdf6a-e116-546b-a8f6-e4cb2e2c0a09

# Similar to the graph creation step, this will run a cost estimation step to give you an estimate of the cost of the graph enrichment process.

```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

If you're using R2R Full, you can similarly check that all `community-summary-*` tasks are completed before proceeding.


Now you can see that the graph is enriched with the following information. We have added descriptions and embeddings to the nodes and relationships. Also, each node is mapped to a community. Following is a visualization of the enriched graph (deprecated as of now. We are working on a new visualization tool):

You can see the list of communities in the graph using the following API endpoint:

- Communities: [Communities](http://localhost:7272/v2/communities?collection_id=122fdf6a-e116-546b-a8f6-e4cb2e2c0a09)

## Search

A knowledge graph search performs similarity search on the entity and community description embeddings.

```bash

r2r search --query="Who is Aristotle?" --use-kg-search

# The answer will be returned in JSON format and contains results from entities, relationships and communities. Following is a snippet of the output:

# Conclusion

In conclusion, integrating R2R with GraphRAG significantly enhances the capabilities of your RAG applications. By leveraging the power of graph-based knowledge representations, GraphRAG allows for more nuanced and context-aware information retrieval. This is evident in the example query we ran using R2R, which not only retrieved relevant information but also provided a structured analysis of the key contributions of Aristotle to modern society.

In essence, combining R2R with GraphRAG empowers your RAG applications to deliver more intelligent, context-aware, and insightful responses, making it a powerful tool for advanced information retrieval and analysis tasks.
