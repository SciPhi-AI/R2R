# Build, deploy and optimize RAG systems

![r2r](./r2r.png)
R2R, short for from `RAG to Riches`, is a Python framework designed for the rapid development production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

## Why did we build this framework?

R2R was conceived to bridge the gap between ad-hoc RAG implementations and robust, production-ready and scaleable solutions.

## Key Features

- **🚀 Rapid Deployment**: Facilitates a smooth setup and development of production-ready RAG systems.
- **⚖️ Flexible Standarization**: `Ingestion`, `Embedding`, `RAG`, and `Evaluation` with proper `Observability`.
- **🧩 Easy to modify**: Provides a structure that can be extended to deploy your own custom pipelines.
- **📦 Versioning**: Ensures your work remains reproducible and traceable through version control.
- **🔌 Extensibility**: Enables a quick and robust integration with various VectorDBs, LLMs and Embeddings Models.
- **🤖 OSS Driven**: Built for and by the OSS community, to help startups and enterprises to quickly build with RAG.
- **📝 Cloud Solution**: Serverless cloud deployment available through [SciPhi](https://app.sciphi.ai).

## Getting Started

To get started with R2R, we recommend setting up the framework and following an initial example.

- [Quick Install](/getting-started/quick-install): Quick setup using `pip`.
- [Full Install](/getting-started/full-install): A more detailed step-by-step setup aimed at complete environment configuration.
- [Basic example](/examples/basic-example): A basic example to get you started with R2R with a RAG pipeline in a server and a client to interact with it.
