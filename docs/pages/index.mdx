R2R, short for RAG to Riches, provides the fastest and most featureful way for developers to deliver high-quality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to end users. The framework ships with a REST API powered by Postgres and pgvector - it includes user-level and document-level management as well as advanced RAG features.

## Why?

R2R was conceived to help developers bridge the gap between local LLM experimentation and serving a scalable, production-ready application. Built with document management, observability and customization in mind, R2R provides adequate performance and features for most RAG use cases.

## Key Features

- **🔧 Build**: Effortlessly create and manage observable, high-performance RAG pipelines with our robust framework. Including multimodal RAG, hybrid search, and latest methods such as HyDE.
- **🚀 Deploy**: Launch production-ready asynchronous RAG pipelines with seamless streaming capabilities
- **🧩 Customize**: Easily tailor your multimodal pipeline using intuitive configuration files to meet your specific needs.
- **🔌 Extend**: Enhance and extend your pipeline with custom code integrations to add new functionalities.
- **🤖 OSS**: Leverage a framework developed by the open-source community, ensuring flexibility, scalability, and ease of deployment.

## Demo(s)
The [R2R Demo](/getting-started/r2r-demo) provides a step-by-step guide to running the default R2R Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) backend. The demo ingests the provided documents and illustrates search and RAG functionality, logging, analytics, and document management.

## Getting Started

To get started with R2R, we recommend setting up the framework and following an initial example.
