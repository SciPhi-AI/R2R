R2R, short for RAG to Riches, provides the fastest and most efficient way to deliver high-quality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to end users. The framework is built around customizable pipelines and a feature-rich FastAPI implementation.

## Key Features

- **🔧 Build**: Use the framework to build arbitrary asynchronous pipelines.
- **🚀 Deploy**: Instantly launch production-ready asynchronous RAG pipelines with streaming capabilities.
- **🧩 Customize**: Tailor your pipeline with intuitive configuration files.
- **🔌 Extend**: Enhance your pipeline with custom code integrations.
- **🤖 OSS**: Benefit from a framework developed by the open-source community, designed to simplify RAG deployment.

## Why did we build this framework?

R2R was conceived to bridge the gap between local LLM experimentation and scalable production solutions. It is built with observability and customization in mind, ensuring that users can seamlessly transition from development to deployment.

## Demo(s)

Using the cloud application to deploy the pre-built basic pipeline:

Note: The example above uses [SciPhi Cloud](https://app.sciphi.ai) to pair with the R2R framework for deployment and observability. SciPhi is working to launch a self-hosted version of their cloud platform as R2R matures.

## Getting Started

To get started with R2R, we recommend setting up the framework and following an initial example.
