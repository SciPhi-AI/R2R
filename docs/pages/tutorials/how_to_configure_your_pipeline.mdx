## How to configure your pipeline

### Introduction

In [Easy Local RAG with R2R: A Step-by-Step Guide](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/tutorials/local_rag), you learned how our framework `R2R` works and how to use the RAG pipeline. Now, let's discuss the `config.json` file in more detail.

### config.json

The `config.json` file is used to set up and configure all services of R2R. It includes settings for embedding, evaluation, language models, logging, ingestion, vector databases, and the application itself.

Each section in the `config.json` file corresponds to a different service or aspect of R2R, and you can customize these settings to fit your needs. For example, you can specify which embedding model to use, how to split text for ingestion, or where to store logs. The `config.json` file helps you easily configure our framework to work the way you want it to.

The `config.json` file is configured by default for cloud-based services, as you can see in the root directory of the R2R GitHub repository ([see here](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R/blob/main/config.json)).

```json
{
  "embedding": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
    "dimension": 1536,
    "batch_size": 32
  },
  "evals": {
    "provider": "parea",
    "frequency": 1.0
  },
  "language_model": {
    "provider": "litellm"
  },
  "logging_database": {
    "provider": "local",
    "collection_name": "demo_logs",
    "level": "INFO"
  },
  "ingestion":{
    "provider": "local",
    "text_splitter": {
      "type": "recursive_character",
      "chunk_size": 512,
      "chunk_overlap": 20
    }
  },
  "vector_database": {
    "provider": "local",
    "collection_name": "demo_vecs"
  },
  "app": {
    "max_logs": 100,
    "max_file_size_in_mb": 100
  }
}
```

To use the configuration you want, simply change the values in the JSON file. For example, if you want to use a Hugging Face `sentence-transformers` embedding model, just change the embedding provider:

```json
  "embedding": {
    "provider": "sentence-transformers",
    "model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
  },
```

To learn what values each section can take, consult the `Config setup` documentation page [here](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/deep-dive/config)

### Try a Different Set Up of the [Easy Local RAG](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/tutorials/local_rag)

You can see the `config.json` set up of our previous tutorial [here](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R/blob/main/r2r/examples/configs/local_ollama.json).

In that example, a local vector database configuration was used. Now let's see how to use `Qdrant` as the vector database and also try a different language model with `ollama`.

#### Use `Qdrant`

To use `Qdrant` as the vector database, you need to have the following values configured in your environment variables:

* `QDRANT_HOST`: Qdrant server host
* `QDRANT_PORT`: Qdrant server port
* `QDRANT_API_KEY`: Qdrant API key

To do this on Linux, type the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
export QDRANT_HOST=http://localhost
export QDRANT_PORT=6333
export QDRANT_API_KEY=DUMMY # use a dummy key for local
```

Then change the vector_database provider in the `config.json` file:
```json
"vector_database": {
      "provider": "qdrant",
      "collection_name": "demo_vecs"
    },
```

#### Use a Different Language Model

In this case, you need to have `ollama` installed on your machine. After that, you will need to run `ollama serve` before starting your RAG process.

```bash
ollama serve
```

#### Run the Easy Local RAG with a Different Set Up

##### Start Qdrant

Since we will now use `Qdrant` as the vector database, we need to start it. Read the `Qdrant` documentation [here](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/quick-start/) for more details.

```bash
docker pull qdrant/qdrant
```

```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    qdrant/qdrant
```

##### Server Standup

Similar to our previous tutorial, the only difference is that we will use a new `config.json` through the `--config` flag.

```python
python -m r2r.examples.servers.basic_pipeline --config testConfig
```

##### Ingesting and Embedding Documents

This step is exactly the same:

```python
python -m r2r.examples.clients.run_qna_client ingest
```

The output should look something like this:

```
> Upload response =  {'message': "File 'meditations.pdf' processed and saved at '/Users/user/R2R/uploads/meditations.pdf'"}
```

##### Running Queries on the Local LLM

As we mentioned previously, to query our knowledge base using ollama, first ensure that you have started the ollama server with this command in the terminal:

```bash
ollama serve
```

Then, to ask a question, run:

```python
python -m r2r.examples.clients.run_qna_client rag_completion \
  --query="What does Marcus Aurelius say about the rules of life?" \
  --model="ollama/phi" # or any other LLM that you have
```

After a brief wait, you should see the LLM's response, perhaps something like:

```bash
'message': {'content': ' Marcus Aurelius says that one should follow the rules of life by being honest, just, and virtuous. He also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a calm and peaceful state of mind in all circumstances. Additionally, he suggests that one should not be swayed by external factors such as pleasure or good fortune, but rather focus on cultivating inner virtues.\n', 'role': 'assistant', 'function_call': None, 'tool_calls': None}}], 'created': 1712946429, 'model': 'ollama/phi', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'usage': {'completion_tokens': 70, 'prompt_tokens': 1021, 'total_tokens': 1091}}}
```

> Marcus Aurelius says that one should follow the rules of life by being honest, just, and virtuous. He also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a calm and peaceful state of mind in all circumstances. Additionally, he suggests that one should not be swayed by external factors such as pleasure or good fortune, but rather focus on cultivating inner virtues.\n


I hope you learned how easy it is to configure the `config.json` file for your use cases.

If you have any questions or want to learn more, [R2R's GitHub repo](https://github.com/SciPhi-ai/R2R), [R2R Discord](https://discord.gg/p6KqD2kjtB), and [docs](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/) are great resources.

Happy building!
