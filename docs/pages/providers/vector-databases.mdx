# Vector Databases

R2R provides a flexible and provider-agnostic approach to integrate with various vector databases for storing and retrieving vector embeddings. The framework includes built-in support for the following vector database providers:

- Local (SQLite)
- PGVector
- Qdrant
- Milvus

## Toggling Between Vector DB Providers

To toggle between different vector database providers, you need to update the `vector_database` section of the configuration file (`config.json`). For example:

```json
"vector_database": {
    "provider": "local",
    "collection_name": "demo_vecs"
}
```

By changing the `provider` value to `"local"`, `"pgvector"`, `"qdrant"`, or `"milvus"` you can switch between the previously mentioned supported vector database providers.


## Local Implementation (SQLite)

The `LocalVectorDB` class is an implementation of the `VectorDBProvider` that uses SQLite as the underlying storage. It stores vector entries along with their metadata in a SQLite database.

Key features of the `LocalVectorDB` implementation:

- Initializes a SQLite database and creates a table for storing vector entries.
- Supports upserting vector entries with their associated metadata.
- Performs similarity search using cosine similarity calculation.
- Allows filtered deletion of entries based on metadata key-value pairs.
- Retrieves unique values for a specific metadata field.

## PGVector Implementation

The `PGVectorDB` class is an implementation of the `VectorDBProvider` that integrates with the PGVector library for storing and retrieving vector embeddings in a PostgreSQL database.

Key features of the `PGVectorDB` implementation:

- Connects to a PostgreSQL database using the provided connection details.
- Initializes a collection with the specified name and dimension.
- Supports upserting vector entries with their associated metadata.
- Performs similarity search using the PGVector library's query functionality.
- Allows filtered deletion of entries based on metadata key-value pairs.
- Retrieves unique values for a specific metadata field.

## Qdrant Implementation

The `QdrantDB` class is an implementation of the `VectorDBProvider` that integrates with the Qdrant vector database for storing and retrieving vector embeddings.

Key features of the `QdrantDB` implementation:

- Connects to a Qdrant server using the provided host, port, and API key.
- Initializes a collection with the specified name and dimension.
- Supports upserting vector entries with their associated metadata.
- Performs similarity search using Qdrant's search functionality.
- Allows filtered deletion of entries based on metadata key-value pairs.
- Retrieves unique values for a specific metadata field.

## Milvus Implementation

The `MilvusVectorDB` class is an implementation of the `VectorDBProvider` that integrates with the Milvus vector database for storing and retrieving vector embeddings.

Key features of the `MilvusVectorDB` implementation:

- Connects to a Milvus Client using the provided URI, Local File Path, and API key.
- Initializes a collection with the specified name and dimension.
- Supports upserting vector entries with their associated metadata.
- Performs similarity search using Milvus's search functionality.
- Allows filtered deletion of entries based on metadata key-value pairs.
- Retrieves unique values for a specific metadata field.

## Configuring Vector DB Providers

To configure a specific vector database provider, you need to set the appropriate environment variables and update the `vector_database` section of the configuration file (`config.json`).

### Local (SQLite)

- Set the `LOCAL_DB_PATH` environment variable to the desired path for the SQLite database file.

### PGVector

- Set the following environment variables with the appropriate values:
  - `POSTGRES_USER`: PostgreSQL database username
  - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: PostgreSQL database password
  - `POSTGRES_HOST`: PostgreSQL database host
  - `POSTGRES_PORT`: PostgreSQL database port
  - `POSTGRES_DBNAME`: PostgreSQL database name

### Qdrant

- Set the following environment variables with the appropriate values:
  - `QDRANT_HOST`: Qdrant server host
  - `QDRANT_PORT`: Qdrant server port
  - `QDRANT_API_KEY`: Qdrant API key

 ### Milvus

- Set the following environment variables with the appropriate values:
  - Initialize via Milvus Lite(store data in local .db file):
      - `MILVUS_URI`: Local '.db' file path
  - Initialize via Docker:
      - `MILVUS_URI`: Docker server host
  - Initialize via Zilliz Cloud:
      - `MILVUS_URI`: Zilliz Cloud end point
      - `ZILLIZ_CLOUD_API_KEY`: Zilliz Cloud api key

Make sure to update the `vector_database` section of the configuration file (`config.json`) with the desired provider and any additional provider-specific settings.
