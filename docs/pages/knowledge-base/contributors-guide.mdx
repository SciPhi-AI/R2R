## How to Contribute

Contributions can take many forms, from code submissions to documentation improvements. Here's how you can get started:

### Pre-Discussion

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository and making your changes in a new branch.

2. **Dependencies**: If your changes introduce new dependencies, ensure they are necessary and properly documented.
