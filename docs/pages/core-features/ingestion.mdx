# Ingestion Pipeline

The Ingestion Pipeline is responsible for processing incoming documents and converting them into plaintext format. It supports various data types such as TXT, JSON, HTML, and PDF.

## Basic Ingestion Pipeline

The `BasicIngestionPipeline` is a simple implementation of the `IngestionPipeline` abstract base class. It provides a straightforward way to process documents based on their data type and yields `BasicDocument` objects.

### Supported Data Types

The `BasicIngestionPipeline` supports the following data types:

- TXT: Plain text format
- JSON: JavaScript Object Notation format
- HTML: Hypertext Markup Language format
- PDF: Portable Document Format

### Processing Data

The `process_data` method is the core of the ingestion pipeline. It takes the `entry_type` and `entry_data` as input, processes the data based on its type, and yields `BasicDocument` objects. It calls the appropriate parsing method for each supported data type.

### Parsing Entry

The `parse_entry` method is a wrapper around the `process_data` method. It takes the `entry_type` and `entry_data` as input, processes the data, and yields the resulting `BasicDocument` objects.

## Custom Ingestion Pipeline

The `CustomIngestionPipeline` is a custom implementation of the `IngestionPipeline` that inherits from the `BasicIngestionPipeline` class. It overrides the `_parse_html` method to use the `unstructured.io` library for parsing HTML documents.

```python
from r2r.pipelines import BasicIngestionPipeline
from unstructured import partition_html

class CustomIngestionPipeline(BasicIngestionPipeline):
    def __init__(self, logging_connection=None):
        super().__init__(logging_connection)

    def _parse_html(self, data: str) -> Iterator[BasicDocument]:
        """
        Override the _parse_html method to use unstructured.io for parsing HTML.
        """
        document_elements = partition_html(text=data)
        text = ""
        for element in document_elements:
            if isinstance(element, (HTMLTitle, HTMLNarrativeText)):
                text += element.text + "\n"
        yield BasicDocument(text=text, metadata={})
```

In this custom implementation, we override the `_parse_html` method to use the `partition_html` function from the `unstructured.io` library for parsing HTML documents. The extracted text is yielded as a `BasicDocument` object.

### Initialization

The `CustomIngestionPipeline` is initialized with the same parameters as the `BasicIngestionPipeline`.

### Pipeline Execution

The `run` method from the base class (`BasicIngestionPipeline`) is used to execute the ingestion pipeline. It processes the incoming documents, yields the resulting `BasicDocument` objects, and uses the overridden `_parse_html` method for HTML parsing.

## Passing the Custom Ingestion Pipeline to the Factory

To use the `CustomIngestionPipeline` with the `E2EPipelineFactory`, you can pass it when creating the pipeline:

```python
from r2r.main import E2EPipelineFactory
from my_custom_pipeline import CustomIngestionPipeline

app = E2EPipelineFactory.create_pipeline(
    config=config,
    ingestion_pipeline_impl=CustomIngestionPipeline,
)
```

By passing the `CustomIngestionPipeline` to the `create_pipeline` method using the `ingestion_pipeline_impl` parameter, the factory will use the custom pipeline instead of the default `BasicIngestionPipeline`.

That's it! You now have a custom ingestion pipeline that uses the `unstructured.io` library for parsing HTML documents and can be passed to the `E2EPipelineFactory` for use in the end-to-end pipeline.
