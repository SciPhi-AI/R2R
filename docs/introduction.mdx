R2R (RAG to Riches), the Elasticsearch for RAG, bridges the gap between experimenting with and deploying production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. It's a complete platform that helps you quickly build and launch scalable RAG solutions. R2R is built around a simple [RESTful API](/api-reference/introduction), making it easy to use and fast to implement.

## Key Features

- **üìÅ Multimodal Support**: Ingest .txt, .pdf, .json, .png, .mp3, and other file types
- **üîç Hybrid Search**: Combine semantic and keyword search for enhanced RAG
- **üîó Graph RAG**: Automatically build knowledge graphs and run GraphRAG on them
- **üë§ User Management**: Easily manage users, documents, and permissions with full authentication.
- **üî≠ Observability**: Observe and analyze performance of your production RAG deployments
- **üîå Extensibility**: Develop your application further with easy builder + factory pattern.
- **üñ•Ô∏è WebApp**: Interact with and manage R2R with the [R2R Application](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R-Application), an open-source React+Next.js front-end with integrated authentication for user-facing applications.
