R2R (RAG to Riches), the Elasticsearch for RAG, bridges the gap between experimenting with and deploying state of the art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. It's a complete platform that helps you quickly build and launch scalable RAG solutions. Built around a containerized [RESTful API](/api-reference/introduction), R2R offers multimodal ingestion support, hybrid search, GraphRAG, user management, and observability / analytics features.

## Key Features
- [**üìÅ Multimodal Ingestion**](/documentation/configuration/ingestion/overview): Parse `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.json`, `.png`, `.mp3`, and more.
- [**üîç Hybrid Search**](/cookbooks/hybrid-search): Combine semantic and keyword search with reciprocal rank fusion for enhanced relevancy.
- [**üîó Graph RAG**](/cookbooks/graphrag): Automatically extract relationships and build knowledge graphs.
- [**üóÇÔ∏è App Management**](/cookbooks/user-auth): Efficiently manage documents and users with full authentication.
- [**üî≠ Observability**](/cookbooks/observability): Observe and analyze your RAG engine performance.
- [**üß© Configurable**](/documentation/configuration/introduction): Provision your application using intuitive configuration files.
- [**üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard**](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R-Dashboard): An open-source React+Next.js app with optional authentication, to interact with R2R via GUI.
