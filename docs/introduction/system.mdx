## System Overview

R2R is built on a modular, service-oriented architecture designed for scalability and flexibility:

1. **API Layer**: A FastAPI-based cluster handles incoming requests, routing them to appropriate services.

2. **Core Services**: Specialized services for authentication, retrieval, ingestion, graph building, and app management.

3. **Orchestration**: Manages complex workflows and long-running tasks using a message queue system.

4. **Storage**: Utilizes PostgreSQL with pgvector for vector storage and search, and graph search.

5. **Providers**: Pluggable components for embedding, LLM, auth, and ingestion services, supporting multimodal ingestion and flexible model integration.

6. **R2R Application**: A React+Next.js app providing a user interface for interacting with the R2R system.

This architecture enables R2R to handle everything from simple RAG applications to complex, production-grade systems with advanced features like hybrid search and GraphRAG.
